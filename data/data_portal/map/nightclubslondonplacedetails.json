          "text": "Myself and two other friends (all gay) attended the venue on Thursday evening. After roughly an hour or so actually in the venue dancing and having only ONE drink (worth mentioning this was all of our 3rd drink of the entire night) we decided it was cigarette time, so we proceeded to the outside smoking area.\n \nAfter our smoke we re-approached the entrance only to be told that we were not allowed back in because we had \"had too much to drink\". This was of course absurd and very confusing as we had literally had one drink in your venue and 2 prior to this, so we were not even on the cusp of tipsy. The doorman who initially refused our entry first picked out one of the three of us as being \"too intoxicated\" and after our friend proved he was not, the doorman then decided to pick on me because I had a limp. \n \nThis instantly proved that the doorman and the rest of your \"security team\" were simply trying to minimise numbers in the venue by any means, and after being told that my limp was due to a Car Accident, the doorman then said, and I quote \"walk for me\", I found this extremely unfair, belittling and a complete abuse of my human rights.\n \nAnother doorman on the door told this other guy that we were all fine as he has initially let us in when we arrived, and he felt there was no reason to refuse us entry, so after our jackets were disgusting chucked at us, we were allowed back in. We spent a maximum of about 15 more minutes in the venue before deciding ourselves to leave, due to the fact our evening in Heaven had been too tarnished with abuse, prejudice behaviour and a complete disregard for our human rights.\n \nWe then went onto have some food and proceed home.\n \nThis email is prelude to a much larger bombardment on the venue and staff as I will be taking this further and posting it on every social media platform I know, and will also be asking if any of the local Brighton, London and south eastern papers would like to be involved in exposing the sort of behaviour your venue has promoted.\n \nAlso, as an ex venue promoter for Brighton and Hove, I know exactly how the club circuit works, especially gay venues and this was an awful representation of what should be a warm, welcoming and comfortable industry to be a part of, be it as a customer or employee.\n \nI am not a greedy, selfish, or abrupt person. However after this atrocious behaviour, I do believe we deserve some form of apology, I especially after being told my temporary disability was fake and being made to walk purely for the amusement of a corrupt and unprofessional \"doorman\".\n \nAlso none of this is even remotely exaggerated and the CCTV will contest to that, in fact the above if anything is underplayed."

It took other customers insisting on my being served for me to be provided with water. I will not be going to Heaven again as the staff was so rude and I did not feel comfortable as a queer woman in what should be an inclusive LGBTQIA venue."

          "text": "The sad thing is that my party actually enjoyed our time INSIDE Heaven. It was the treatment we got outside that causes this review. Some of the bouncers were abominably rude to us, even though as a party of 15+ we were clearly going to be buying quite a few drinks. The female bouncer was particularly nasty and unhelpful. Despite me phoning up the day before to explicitly ask Heaven if getting a guest list would mean that we'd be able to get in hassle-free on Friday night at 12:30, the bouncer at the door told me this was \"complete rubbish\", begging the question what on earth is the point of a guest list if people can't get in? One of my party was arbitrarily barred from going in for asking about the guest list system. Two stars and unlikely to receive another visit from me or any of my friends, especially when hired bouncers, ESPECIALLY the female bouncer on Friday nights, are extremely rude and unhelpful to paying customers."

I did not have a drink and just finished work. I have a slight disability and I walk ''funny'' and that what I think was it. Thank you idiots for ruining my night. Also spoke to the 'manager'. Security pointed to a guy completely stoned, he did not said a word when I complained. Not sure of security either the guys didn't have their SIS Badges and refused to give their names.

I suppose with such a reputation you're going to get a good handful of people you'd probably not want to share a night with. But that's why you have friends, right?

          "text": "This club is unique in so many ways and epitomises what clubbing is all about. The three rooms provide a perfect balance without giving too much focus on any particular room. The sound system is excellent with Europe's first “bodysonic” vibrating bass dancefloor in room 1. The labyrinth-like caverns, arches and staircases provide a wonderful space to get lost in and simply enjoy the music for what it is. The music is almost all electronic, spanning a huge variety of genres (drum & bass, house, techno, electro, garage, dubstep, jungle and more), so if this music is not for you or you are looking for a 'regular club night' playing the latest chart/cheese then fabric is not for you! The lighting, smoke and atmosphere all add to the amazing clubbing experience and there is ample seating space throughout the club with huge leather sofa-like recliners near room 2. There are five bars, two cloakrooms and an outdoor smoking area. The only downfall is the occasional difficult bouncers, so be patient on the way in, because once you get in you will realise the long wait is most certainly worth it!"

They have 3 bars so you don't have to wait too long for drinks and no matter how far away you are from the stage, you are almost guaranteed a good view! (I think the angle of the floor is subtle and the stage is just high enough to make a difference!) They have an upstairs mezzanine area also so if you don't want to be in the thick of it or want to chill in a booth, the option is there. Of course, the sound depends on a variety of factors but when these lined up, the riffs were crisp and the vocals audible enough to sing along with! The staff that work there are helpful and lovely also. Good place for a big rock gig! "

They are no help at all for simple things, like providing a private spot for a hired professional Santa to change for 5 minutes, except in a toilet, despite paying £100 for booking and providing people drinking at their venue. \n\nOn many occasions asked questions multiple times with no answer. And when wanted to do £16 per person buffet of food, got attitude like i'm being difficult. Originally was doing the £12.95 buffet, so was providing another £3 per person. Odd. This reply consisted of a suggestion to find another venue and will get my full deposit back. If wasn't 4 days prior I would. A quote I like \"I’ve never had some much trouble trying to organize such a small party!\" I have 30 ppl. Talk about stuck up. Id expect the same effort if it was 5 people or 50. In the end they cancelled my booking 2 days prior as I complained about the customer service but really they wanted the room for a larger group I found out.\n\nWill pop in for my drinks now and then as I do but won't again organize a event with them.

If you are not entirely fed up with that, it is a nice place to have a drink. It has both seating on the open deck as well on the bridge and the inside of the boat below. It is especially pleasant on decent weather around sunset time. You might want to tone down the alcohol consumption, because combined with the swaying of the boat I assume it it will definitely have an unpleasant outcome."

We returned a few hours later to catch a taxi to the station and they kindly offered to load our bags into the taxi after we had collected them. It was not until we got to the train station did we realise that a rucksack with my daughters ipad in was not with us. With only a few minutes until our train my husband had to dash back, only to be told that we gave in six bags and six were collected. We very naively trusted the porter to take those bags straight into the storage room while we waited in a queue for our ticket and did not count the exact number of bags(a lesson!!) Eventually my husband got the rucksack back but we missed our train and incurred extra charges. I explained this to the head of luggage and he said, \"sorry!\""

Despite paying an over priced entrance, and an additional £900 for a friends birthday to be celebrated- we were given a lot of attitude by staff, especially bouncers. They refused our entry and when asked why, they angrily replied 'we legally don't have to give you a reason to allow you back in'. I would understand if I had been drunk, or even slightly wobbly- but I was neither. There was no justification for the way their bouncers had treated my friends and I. The birthday girl was told to 'wait outside for 15 minutes to cool down'. She also had not been tipsy and was not given any reasoning as to why she was told to wait outside. Strongly recommend you do not waste your time or money here. "

It is highly recommended to enter before 9pm due to the entrance is free. In addition, this will make you avoid the big queues outside. The club is divided in 6 different spaces: The Tiger bar, The Tiger Grill, The Cloud Lounge, The Groovy Wonderland, The White room and The Opal bar. You will find a different music style in any of these rooms, so there is a huge music choice for everybody. It is a good option to pre-book a table if you are a big group due to you will have some extra benefits in alcohol and food packages. Drinks are bit expensive so it is recommendable to go there for the happy hour (normally from 5pm to 8pm). Apart from that it is a classic club on the Londoners’ night which is worthy to visit. "

It’s got a good sized outdoor area for eating and smoking (not really my flavour). But all the same, it’s good if you need some “fresh air” and for a chat or as a meeting point… \n\nOn Fridays, the main room is The Gallery and on Saturdays, it’s The Box. There’s also Baby Box – I’m guessing it’s where you can chill, but honestly I am always in The Box, so I really would know. You can get free membership at The Gallery and paid membership for The Box. Membership gives you a small discount and some other perks.\n\nThe cloakroom is quick as is the bar – but beware, two cocktails will set you back about £17+! I say, don’t drink there or drink beforehand! The crowd is also really respectful – just go!\n"

'Damian' refused to give us his name and was purposefully blocking his ID card from view so we couldn't obtain his details. After having asked for the manager we were then made to wait for another half an hour outside in the cold before she was able to see us. 'Beth' (manager) agreed that we were not too drunk to enter but despite this still wouldn't allow us inside (again with no due reason), it was also only due to her arrival that 'Damian' would give his name.\n\nToday we phoned the venue and spoke to the general manager 'Simon' who was quiet possibly the worst manager I have ever dealt with. He repeated told us it was probably our fault for either (listing repeatedly) 1. No ID, 2. Being too drunk, 3. Having been barred and refused to even consider our side of the case. He repeatedly said \"well what do you want me to do about it?\", he refused to make any form of contact with the door staff or manager from the evening,he kept interrupting and attempting to blame us for last nights discourses and made numerous assumptions as to our behavior, insinuating that were were drunk and aggressive, despite him not even being present the night before.\n\nWhen trying to end the phone call, I asked him to talk to the manager and door staff from the previous night and to then email me with his/their response, his response was an indignant \"I am NOT taking your email.\" After having expressed our concern over the multitude of bad reviews of the club (based almost solely on the rude staff) and with this unacceptably response, I informed the manager that he could expect four more negative reviews and four less customers and ended the phone call.\n\nAvoid The Roxy and its staff unless you want to be abused and victimized.

I made a reservation for a table of 10 at 23.00 on Saturday 8th of November. \n\nMy group arrived at 22.45. At the door we were told that my table booking was made for 21.00 and I was two hours late thus my table had been given away. I produced my string of emails and booking form that clearly stated 23.00 to the man at the door, but was told (rudely) that nothing could be done. I then asked if any larger, thus more expensive tables were available as it was really important to me that I got in and celebrated my birthday. I was told no, and I was also told my group was too big to be accommodated (there were only eight of us) - we were not allowed to enter the club. I asked to speak to those I had been liaising with but was told they only work during the day.\n\nI would like to point out at this point that my group were all EXTREMELY well presented. The six females were in dresses and heels, and the two males wore shirts, trousers and shoes. We were a mixed group all with ID. We followed every recommendation you had made. I also had my large birthday cake with me as I had also previously discussed with you, a cake that had cost me £90.00 and had been made for the occasion with a Mahiki style theme. \n\nThe man at the door was quite rude and did not sympathise with my situation. We were refused entry despite offering to pay double the original minimum spend for a table. Now here is where one of the biggest issues lies. We were asked to not stand outside the club and thus stood across the road as we discussed what to do and were approached by a local promoter. Behind us in the queue were a group of six females, one of whom I knew and had had a brief discussion with in the queue. I therefore know that her group did not have a table reserved and were already highly intoxicated. As I stood on the other side of the road I was absolutely furious to see that these girls were granted admission to the club. \n\nLet me tell you something about my group of eight. I myself am a white British female. There was a white male, a black male, a black female, an Asian female and three mixed race females. I believe my group were turned away on racial grounds. How can your organisation clearly have made a mistake and not offer any kind of agreement or compromise? Why were the group of six white, blonde females allowed in but we weren't? Why were we ushered to the other side of the road, as if to say we made the club look bad? \n\nI am absolutely outraged at the way I was treated and I honestly believe if my group had been all white, this would not have happened. It's disgusting that we were turned away after so many weeks of planning and liaising. Any mistakes made were on your (Mahiki's) part, and yet it not only cost me financially, but it ruined my birthday night, that I will never get back. \n\nIt' also funny how since the night i have emailed them and had no reply. Disgusting"

My first impression was not that good though, as I expected a bit more from the interior than the Hawaiian décor. We ordered the Pina Colada cocktails and I started forgetting about the décor, as the music was something I loved a lot! The mix of pop and r&b and even alternative, is exactly what I need to get in the mood and to have a fun night out in the company of my friends."

A good place to bring people visiting because of the following:\n1) played British classics, like Stop - Spice Girls, Rock DJ - Robbie Williams\n2) just the right mix of 'poshness' and 'laid back ness' - almost (but not quite) like East meets West\n3) famous stars have shown up here for those who are in love with the idea of partying in places where celebs have been (makes for a good story)\n4) the drinks are amazing. the pina colado comes in a pineapple. 15 for 1 but very much so worth it!\n\nThis place has two floors - one that serves food (mediocre food but gets you into the club to enjoy it a bit before the mayhem starts and is a way to avoid the lines), and the other with a dance floor with tiki torches. For those out to really celebrate, get a group and purchase the Treasure Chest!\n\nThe female servers were dressed in Hawaiian outfits & the male servers as pirates. One the servers even spoke in a 'pirate' accent.\n\nOverall - a bit cheesy & tacky & wouldn't make it a regular haunt, but a fun place overall to dance & bring friends from out of town! "

Of a pint of beer and maybe no insults to go with it??! (I know, so bloody naive-And I gave them a fiver to be offended?)

Tables are spaced nicely around the band(s) to ensure intimacy but without being in their face, and as well as more established jazz acts there are also a number of great up and coming acts given a chance to shine.\n\nThe price of the beers is a bit on the steep side, but worth it for the quality of music and the setting."

In the winter, they rigged up a giant wigwam to stave off the weather and now, it's a perfect open destination for when the sun decides to shine. At weekends they hold a Rooftop Film Club and they're announcing pop-up food events over the summer. I drank a 'Don't Go to Dalston' (from the downstairs bar) and mintless raspberry mojitos (they'd run out), after really fancying a Bloody Mary (but no tomato juice).

A design that completely runs through the whole hotel, from the rooftop, down to the breakfast room and mainly attracts a young and sophisticated target group.\n\nIts location is great and racking my brain over it before was redundant. I haven’t been to London for several years and thought that the hotel’s location at Tower Hill would be too far off but again I was wrong. The surrounding transformed over the years and with areas like Shoreditch and Bermondsey close by it is a great starting point to discover the city’s nightlife in the East. \nIf you prefer a classier surrounding than the new hotspots the area around St. Katherine’s Pier or at Butlers Wharf have a lot of variety to explore.\n\nThe tube is around the corner and within 10 minutes you are at Embankment. When you cross Tower Bridge you can walk the opposite river shore up to Lambeth. After exploring London with its many touristy and packed areas you will really enjoy the hotel’s location.\nAlthough there are still tourists around this area is just so incredible off the crowds – awesome! \n\nBTW – from the rooftop bar you have a scenic view over Tower Bridge, the Gherkin, and other sights in the city.\n"

Watching them make the drinks was almost as impressive as the drinks themselves. We also got some free snack popcorn to munch on while we drank and conversed.\n\nThe band was excellent and not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation despite the small size of the underground establishment. The staff was friendly and helpful and even gave this North Carolinian a pack of NightJar playing cards on the way out. It was, by far, the best bar I went to in my week visit to London.\n\nShould I ever find myself back in London, I will be sure to make reservations for this club. It should not be missed!\n"

The cocktails were amazing - we had a couple of sharing ones and they came out beautifully presented and tasted fantastic. We had plenty to last us all evening (which was good for us, as we were on a bit of a budget). The loos could have been nicer, but that's really the only criticism I can find."

For an airport hotel where the prime purpose is to relax before/after a long flight etc. this hotel must simply be avoided!! \n\nBy the time you factor in the extras and the poor relaxation you might as well pay the extra price and go elsewhere.

Its valve for money if you stay & park and with your reward points it allows you a free breakfast next time you stay. Wi-Fi last time was free and they will always print off your boarding cards as an extra bonus without charge. The Hoppa bus is expensive but walk to Hatton Cross (Watch the Traffic) and the regular service bus is free. \r\nThe hotel staff you will find friendly and the hotel clean – the rooms are quite but travellers do get up early and forget others are still sleeping. The bar manager remembers his regulars and offers his hand every time – he still remembers my name and asks about my family if I’m travelling alone. \r\nBreakfast is a must you can eat until you are full (I do) bar meals and drink are pricey but if you are on a budget there is a shop at Hatton Cross where you can by snacks. Note: the hotel allows you to have a takeaway delivered to the hotel. \r\nA good place to start any trip – long haul flights it’s a must park your car in a secure car park and relax – highly recommend. \r\n"

Upon arrival you are greeted by a nice modern interior and friendly bubbly staff although it can take a moment to grab there attention in order to check in. \n\nThe room's: Upon walking through the door first thoughts are \"what a lovely room\" Decent sized bathroom and a rather modern décor to the room. Unfortunately this is where it ends staying on the second floor facing the DLR is not a room I was comfortable in. Staying in this hotel for 2 days meant no natural light coming into the room as you are pretty much at eye level with the DLR trains meaning ZERO privacy. These rooms would benefit greatly from better sound proofing and also one way glass giving the guests the privacy they expect in any hotel room.\n\nBreakfast: Sadly I was left VERY DISAPPOINTED not only by the layout which in my opinion needs a complete re think (Some tables are very awkward to be sat at as you have people bumbling past every few seconds) Also the food was in my opinion worse than even a motorway service station! Flavourless bacon which was clearly cooked long before I arrived no sausages available as they where still in the oven cooking (This shows a total lack of observation to the trays) The tomatoes simply grilled with zero seasoning or even a trickle of skill and the mushrooms where ruined by the total lack of flavour. I stayed for 2 nights and on a B&B basis i attended breakfast once and was left appalled.\n\nNights sleep: Unfortunately on night 1 my night was interrupted by noisy guests at past 1 am screaming for help to get away from a \"man\" After a few guests shouted at him all settled down but you would of thought the hotel would attract a better clientèle Secondly the DLR and work done at night is rather intrusive on the second floor so again more sound proofing needed.\n\nCheck out: Swift as I used the quick check out option \n\nWould I stay again: After staying in several Hilton hotels around the world I would have to say no. I know of cheaper and much more comfortable hotels in the same area.\n\nRoom: 212 \nDates stayed 30/05/14 - 01/05/14"

That being said, the tiny club area and poor sound system don't help...\n\nDont waste an evening of your life here - go throw £100 in the thames and spend the evening playing on a train track - it'll be a cheaper evening, and almost certainly more fun."

I went for it's soft opening last weekend - three times it was so good!! It was 50% off so I made the most of it while I could! Both the food and design were faultless. \n\nDESIGN:\nI fell head over heels in love with their beautiful design touches, particularly the combination of dark wooden flooring with chequered floor tiles around the bar, the exposed brickwork, tweed covered seats and eye catching lanterns over the bar. \n\nFOOD:\nThe braised beef ribs for two to share melted in the mouth and came paired with pumpkin, forest mushrooms and horseradish mash - yum!! My friends also had killer dishes. For starters we loved the palourde clams with ham and sherry and the fritto misto with roast fennel, as well as my beautiful meaty rock oysters. \n\nFor the main event, (aside from the ribs) we were blown away by the pork shoulder with apples and celeriac, the wild rabbit and mushroom fricassee with kale (this was my favourite) and their roast chicken with quail scotch eggs (that's just for Sunday roast though).\n\nThen, for dessert I can recommend the honey roast autumn fruits with vanilla ice cream, the custard and nutmeg tart and last but not least their sticky toffee pud. God, this is making me hungry just writing about the place! \n\nDRINK:\nI also loved their interesting mix of top notch wines, their prosecco on tap and my guy mates loved their selection of craft beers. Oh and I also had a great cappuccino which comes with a very tasty artisan pistachio shortbread on the side. \n\nAll that's left now is to try out their very appealing (and very distinctive) breakfast menu! I will definitely be back!! If you're around the Exmouth Market area it is definitely worth trying out, whether it's just a chilled drink or a full meal. "

The concierge and desk staff were very helpful and nice enough to help me with any request I had. I would definitely stay here again. "

Without the attitude of the West End you are easily able to strike up conversation. The outside space is a great asset and there is a mixed crowd on most occasions. One slight frustration can be the price of the drinks although they are lower than West End standards"

The music is`nt too over powering that you cant enjoy a good chat and it`s very friendly & welcoming.\nThe weekend bursts full of character. From Thursday to Sunday anyone who loves going out in London will pass through the doors during this time. There is something different every Thursday night which draws in a great mix of people. Tonka friday`s is always nice and busy with bar food and the odd free shot! Saturdays has a different party each week with a BBQ`s or free shots depending on which night is on and to round up your week, finish it with a BANG! that is Horse Meat Disco! Not only will you feel like your part of a modern Studio 54 with the best Disco tracks from yesteryear but it will leave you wanting more which is why it has become the place to go on Sunday nights. Don`t be surprised if you see the odd celebrity there too!!! ; )\nHave Fun!!!!! :)"

Also it means there is no phone signal. On the plus, the stage was set up well so I could see the acts (even from the back row) and they had a full bar, which they served efficiently."

The burger itself is yummy as is.\n\nDrinks: We ordered two beers with dinner. \n\nPrice: For two people we paid 45.28 GBP.\n\nAmbiance: The outdoor patio is great when the weather is nice. Definitely get there early since it's first come first serve.

We then asked for an ale recommendation only be told that she didn't like that as well. I ordered the steak and my friend the venison. About 10 minutes after we had the order taken, the manager lady who also took our order returned to inform me that they had run out of steak. I ordered the venison instead, then about 5 mins later another waiter returned to say we that they couldn't take the temperature and then another waiter came to say the same thing and then another one. After finishing the main the rude lady manager waiter then came back again and after we repeated we didn't want dessert 5 times she finally left! Over all a really poor experience, however the food was good and the blonde girl waitress very nice. "

The food is decent but unspectacular, and, together with the somewhat tired décor and competent but occasionally uncoordinated service, does not make for a competitive dining choice.

The club isn't as big as some other clubs e.g. Piccadilly Institute and Ministry of Sound, but its still a nice club to go to. Luckily, its never been hugely packed when I've been so I was actually able to walk around without rubbing up anyone else.....\nWould recommend going to if you're in Central London and looking for a night out."

The room was really nice and tidy and the bathroom was great. The pool and saunas were perfect. Exactly what was needed after the traveling. The provision of towels could have been a little more straightforward, but nothing to really complain about. The whole atmosphere is so relaxed and welcoming. There is a small outside area to sit and drink/ eat relax in. It would be really nice if this was bigger to accommodate more guests but was still lovely. The largest complaint was having to wait for 30mins for a cocktail, which, when it arrived, had no alcohol in it. Another one was provided another 15mins or so later free of charge. Took a very long time. Other than that, a great experience and will be back again!"

The hotel itself is pleasant enough, and the room was well finished, but one thing I really need a hotel to get right - especially when I'm on business - is enable me to get a good night's sleep. Unfortunately the rock hard mattress and noise from what I think was a hot water heater (which constantly cycled on and off throughout the night) meant I slept poorly.\n\nThe price is reasonable, so I suppose that should be taken into account, but to have to pay extra for a shuttle bus or WiFi is simply penny-pinching in my opinion. After all, how many people who stay at an isolated airport close to nothing but an airport won't use the shuttle?\n\nMy own experience wasn't great, but yours may be better. After all, this is a perfectly decent hotel. Maybe pack a set of ear plugs if you're a light sleeper."

I spoke to the manager who spoke to the door staff and agreed I could bring it in on the promise of not consuming it in the venue. Obviously I agreed.\nWe went downstairs for the main do, we had a small area reserved which soon filled up and other people were coming down as there is a strange/small dance are in the room next door where music was playing.\nThe décor is not great, the atmosphere was great, but due to the party guests not the place. The drinks post 8pm were overpriced, hopefully to save up for redecorating and the staff were quite abrupt at the end of the night in trying to get people out.\nI wouldn't recommend it for the area, although it didn't spoil a great party."

Having been an experienced clubber in the 2000's, I know the drill. But as I approached him, the badly organised queue led me to tripping and giving the bouncer a remark that the fence is too far from the pavement and as such is dangerous. This is where the bouncer felt inclined to comment I was \"spaced out!!\" He proceeded to search me thoroughly including all my pockets and a bag search with a 4 inch flash light! He felt authorised to dispose all he thought was trash in my bag, like bits of paper or empty water bottles. He stole (took for him self and put it in his pocket) the last remaining dustings of my 420. Finally, having checked every little pocket of my wallet and the amount of money I had on me, he cattled me through to the club.I felt utterly harassed and violated. This is where my visit ended. On the exit, I spoke to a few friends who all seem to agree this behaviour is usual and, as such, normal. I disagree. I was there to spend a good evening with friends, enjoy some music, have a drink and go home reminiscing a pleasant experience. That can't happen if the club chooses to proceed with Drakon entrance policies, that I do understand have their healthy and safety role, but their execution is law violation. Even the police needs a reasonable grounds of suspicion for a search. I wouldn't recommend this club to anyone."

This was a serious party, where people took pride in the way they dressed to ensure they complied with the time's fashions. No one looked like they in costumes, and if anyone was, it was obvious and strange. People really went out of their way to wear authentic clothes from the that time. Men wore uniforms, women wore dresses with bright red lipstick and their hair up in Victory rolls. The setting is also perfect because the Village Underground is an old warehouse with only windows on the ceiling, so you did get the feel you were in some kind of shelter. There was a live swing band performing that were so very talented. There were ladies there doing girls' hairdos for free with Victory rolls and such. The people are creative, relaxed and friendly. My only recommendation is make sure you dress in layers when you go to the Village Underground. Outside can be cold and inside can be scorching hot. I highly recommend the Blitz Party at the Village Underground. "

There is a lot of bribery within the staff (security, managers, DJ's...) and some 'favourite' girls (which aren't the prettiest or more talented ones). These 'favourite' girls tip substantially the staff so they can access high spender customers easily with no competition. Good customers are escorted by security to their tables, then they are only introduced by the 'favourite' girls (which aren't the best girls), the management and security make sure that other girls don't approach the big spenders. Actually if other girls try to reach these customers and complain about security being unfair, then the management sack them, that's how unfair and dodgy this club's workplace is for the girls. Now, if you are an intelligent customer with money to spend in return of great fun, when you come in go to the bar, get a drink, and choose the girl that you like. If the staff persist that you should go with certain girls, say no, it's your choice. When you make a choice and you are happy talking to a girl, if she is all of the sudden called on the stage, just take her straight away for a dance to skip the stage (DJ's are tipped by the 'favourites' so they don't dance on the stage and call girls talking to customers so the 'favourites' can grab these customers. During the dance you will have more time to decide to take your girl to the VIP, unless you have done it already. I'm sure the DJ will be pestering your girl to go on the stage as soon as you come out of the booth."

The best strip club I had been at the time. \n\nThe decor is probably the best I've seen. This place has quite a cool atmosphere. The only downside can be some constantly moving disco lighting that sometimes can get in your eye and irritate you.\n\nWith a negative now. This place is not what it used to be. It is NOT a Gentlemen's club. It is a low lifes place as far as the strippers are concerned. Where before I could hardly find a rude one, these days they are everywhere, they are aggressive, pushy, will get your for a private dance only to start proposing what else you could get if you pay more, they will lie about the duration of their dances and generally they will treat you like a soulless cash machine. Surely not all girls are the same but i can speak confidently that the vast majority of the girls are complete idiots of no class. It is very obvious to me that the management doesn't give a toss of who they hire.\n\nNow as far as the handling goes from the management while you are there I have goods things to say. Few times i had to complain about something and they were always attentive and very professional in dealing with it.\nThey do seem to genuinely care. At the same time i don't get how they have so many low lifes working there for them.\n\nIn addition this place has nowadays terrible waitresses. They will try to rob you on purpose. I have had this happened to me more than once and remember i was a regular for a long time and am in a position to know. What they do these days is to keep your change or as with some other staff to try to subtly psychologically black mail you in order for you to leave a tip. This begging/aggressive attitude that I have seen really does no favors to this place. Be aware of the waitresses. It is up to the customer to decide when to tip and how much.\n\nLastly the quality of the girls in terms of looks is slightly above average in my opinion.\n\nIf you care about class, manners and a human attitude avoid this place. You will be treated like a loser but I suppose you would expect mostly losers in places of this caliber. There are better strip clubs out there, places that are REAL Gentlemens clubs with capital G.\n"

However, based on the idea that if we had booked with Hilton directly and had to pay £100+ I would not say that the hotel is worth it. \n\nLocated a fifteen minute walk from Canada Water the hotel is a little out of the way. If you want to get food near your hotel then you are better off getting something at the mini retail park near Canada Water station (if Pizza Hut & Frankie and Bennies is your thing) or getting something before going to the hotel as there is just one pub near the hotel itself. \n\nOur hotel room was of reasonable size with a partial river view. There was a small balcony but it wasn't clean and there were no chairs to sit out on it. We don't smoke but if you are a smoker then I imagine it will be perfect for you as its not fitted to do much else. \n\nThe bed was wooden and creaked terribly but apart from that was quite comfortable. The black out blinds were fantastic as we had wanted to make use of the late check out, however, the cleaners came at 9am, 10am and again at 11am to check if we had left our room. Needless to say we felt pressured to check out as they wanted to clean the room which wasn't the relaxing experience we had expected. \n\nAll in all this is not a bad hotel but I wouldn't say it's any better than a Travel Lodge or a Holiday Inn. Yes, there are more facilities like the spa, fitness centre etc but the spa had been out of order for four days prior to our arrival and so the supposed 'luxury' extras didn't make a difference for us. As a place to put your head down for the night it's decent but nothing special. There are much nicer hotels which a much more central location for the price they are charging. (However, for £54 that we paid? It was great.)"

If anything is stolen they are in no way helpful, its as they're saying \" Yah, ok. Your stuff got stolen. We'll pretend to be helpful to make ourselves look and blame the rest on you. Oh! and we'll also ALWAYS say you 'lost it' instead of it being stolen. If anyone is planning to go ice-skating, then i'd recommend Natural History museum in winter, or Alexandra Palace witch is open all year. DO NOT go to Queens for iceskating. If you are having lessons, the teacher are great, very kind. The shoes are made of plastic and will give you blisters, and after they redo the ice they let you go on with ought it being dry, so your skating on half ice half water."

We put our bags right next to us and after 15min of playing one bag was GONE! Management was not cooperative at all to call the police nor to show us pics on the camera that was right above our heads. !st the cashier said noone was allowed to vision thefilm apart rom the police. They did not call the police when asked several times, then they told us to call them ourselves...(we're French we don't even know what the number would be) They said after 20 minutes of waiting and anguishing (all our passports, credit cards, money, keys ...etc were inside that bag) that the angle was not right and that they could not vision the film. When we threatenend to sue them, all of a sudden they accepted to show us the film which clearly showed that the people next to us had stolen our bag. We asked them for the French embassy number and the answer was: \"surf yourself to the number...\" Eventually when i complained to the police that these people were not cooperating and that something was fishy (we suspected they were involved), magically the bag reappered between the game machines with everything inside. THIS IS a TERRIBLE PLACE TO GO TO..DON'T EVER SET FOOT THERE!! N\"Y ALLEZ PA!!! VOUS ALLEZ VS FAIRE ENTUBER D\"UNE FACON OU D\"UNE AUTRE. We said we were going to open a file against them but didn't have time to go to a police station and were too happy and relieved to go back home with our passports...All neighboring shops told us that this kind of felony was happening EVERYDAY in that place!!! Don't use your LONDON PASS to go there, pick another destination!!!!! "

Its all brightly coloured juices, purées and sugar basically but heck at 2 4 1 until 9pm - whose complaining!? There are themed rooms and the place has various sounds coming from each. Its a bit of a mish mash of messy after work drinkers and tourists come 9.01pm."

The staff were rude....1 girl was walking around with shots to sell but was more focused on dancing and enjoying herself so when she bumped into me and the drinks fell she demanded an apology. I refused as she was drinking more shots than she was selling. I ordered a bottle of JD to come to our table the girl said it was £150 but when I went to pay with my debt card she said I had to go to the bar if I had no cash. I walked 3 steps and it cost me £130 so she was blatantly ripping me off. I also tried to order a skittle bomb at the bar where there was a new bar maid who noticed it was not on the menu and asked another more senior staff member to price up the drinks so she could serve me. The more senior girl said if it was not on the menu she could not serve it. I walked to the bar around the corner ordered the same drink and they served me no problem. I went to the toilet and tipped the toilet attendant as you do. Later on I needed to go toilet again and this cheeky so and so demanded I pay more. At this point I told him what he could do with himself. When this place was on and on it wasn't amazingly fantastic but it was not to the point where I actually wanted to come home and write a review as to what a joke this place is. I had no problem with the music or the other guests. But there is something that seriously needs addressing in this place so now you have been warned."

Most meals were around the £10 mark, we used a TasteCard which made our lunch even cheaper. \nWill definitely be back for more of the menu at some point soon. YUM "

They wouldn't let me reserve terrace space but assured me that it wouldn't be busy. When I arrived the terrace was full to capacity with a queue out the door. With minimal seating, my friends and I were forced to stand in a traffic area where we continuously got harassed by security to move (problematic seeing as one of my friends was on crutches). Once the crowd thinned out we finally got seats, but by then the terrace had stopped serving drinks -- no drinks after 10pm. I would return to Big Chill again but only for a quick rooftop pint, and never again in a big group. Lesson learned!"

In London, you sort of get used to being treated like cattle, but what we experienced on Saturday night will ensure that we, or our friends, will never be back to Zigfrid von Underbelly. \n\nWe were a bit slow moving from the main room towards the downstairs section, to which one of the bouncers reacted by shouting at us. He quickly got worked up to being physically aggressive towards my girlfriend and spilled her first-round drink over her head. This obviously didn’t go down well with me and we got promptly kicked out, along with our friends, after having just bought a £100 round. \n\nThe bouncer continued shouting at us, in front of his supervisor (who did nothing, obviously) and guests walking in and out.

The shower is reminiscent of an RV, plastic bottom and extremely small as well. \n\nOur view overlooks a roof and all of the others that are staying. The 27 inch tv is docked to the walls with the wires hanging out with around 20 channels. \n\nThe bar/lounge area has poor service. Expect to get up multiple times to place an order, check on your order and pick up your food. Pretty pricing for the quality as well, $70 for a pizza and burger. They also don't have to go boxes, so the busser wrapped my plate in plastic wrap.\n\nOverall, for the price and location there are better options.\n"

Worth booking in advance and reserving a table/sofa in the VIP area as its a great place to watch sport. They also have a huge projector screen. Toilets could do without the toilet guy and being slightly cleaner. The bouncers on the door ID everyone that comes through (yes even if you look ancient) so bring your credentials.

Drinks arrived quickly and there's a decent selection available from the bar. Sadly the food was a massive disappointment. Four of us went for the steak and chips at £15 and we all agreed that it was a really bad quality steak. Being British - and very hungry - we carried on eating rather than complaining.

I called over the manager to raise concern over the tea I was given, my friend also sharing concern over what I had been given to drink, noting the tainted smell and taste as well. The manager stated that she could not smell anything wrong. Before I could say anything else she very abruptly said \"what exactly do you want? Another mint tea or not?\". She then explained that if she were to offer me a replacement that it would \"all taste the same\". I once again stated that the tea tasted really bad and I politely declined her offer for a replacement, asked for her name and then left.\n\nI was really surprised by the reaction of a manager of a food and drink outlet to not be concerned at all by the quality and safety of the goods being offered to customers and she did not seem to even think to investigate further a product that had been highlighted as horrible and had just been ingested by a member of the general public on the premises. \n\nI will not be going back and have never faced such horrible produce and service in London before."

Drinks are quite inventive with a couple of impressive flaming cocktails being mixed. Prices are average yet a bit overpriced for a chain. Nibbles deliver though with nachos platter providing a satisfying snack to go with cocktails. Overall, Barrio will deliver and provide a fun and unpretentious night. "

          "text": "Urgh... Whatever you do, don't \"eat\" here!\n\nAhh.. So if you're so inclined to believe that the plethora of tables and the rather fetching colourful, some may say playful, menus that contain various Mexican inspired food stuffs; in addition to the vacant, somewhat expressionless waiting staff constitutes what some may call a restaurant. You couldn't be more wrong.\n\nI had the pleasure of attempting to dine here Sunday 12 October 2014 circa 6.30pm. There were maybe 4 tables with people sitting on them, and about 50% of these tables had people waiting for food. Considering that there are appx. 30-40 tables, based on performance, this appears to be the restaurant operating at full capacity, full steam ahead, flat out, and other such inspiring phrases.\n\nThe reason why i assume this to be true is the 45 minute wait for a starter that did not arrive. having enquired several times as to the status of the order, I was eventually told after an hour that it was 2 minutes away. At this point, the hour long wait for Gambas (or prawns) was too much and i decided to cancel my order.\n\nUnfortunately, my dining partner at this point had been told that his main had not been ordered. He unlike me, still believed that he was in some kind of restaurant and reordered his main, completely unaware that we were on some sort of Star Trek holodeck, that I now assume had been taken over by Klingons, and they were using the venue to masquerade as a restaurant/cum salsa bar for some as of yet unexplained sinister evil reason.\n\nIn the meantime they brought us some complimentary water, and a couple dirty glasses with remnant’s of a previous citrus drink. Unsurprisingly we decided to pass up the beverage.\n\nUnfortunately, after another 20 mins, he was told that his food had been cancelled, and they brought a bill which had NOT been requested for a 'chimichanger', whatever that is?! and a shot of vodka. \n\nWe were then asked to give the table back as it was urgently needed to serve more hungry customers. At this point we decided to leave, and it’s a fair bet that neither of us will ever frequent this fine establishment again.\n"

Firstly, you have the option to have a nice dinner there. The menu is based on different types of appetizers such as Spanish Tapas, Mexican Fajitas and grilled dishes. The drink menu is wide and offers a huge variety of cocktails. After that, Salsa classes are provided by a professional teacher. This is the perfect opportunity to join to a group and give your firsts step into Salsa. It is such a fun that even if you are not good at it you will be laughing. Later on, the dance floor becomes to a normal club with different types of music. On this club people kindly comes to you to ask to dance with them. Therefore, there are plenty of chances to meet new people. Smiles and laughs are guaranteed. "

          "text": "I went to Shaka Zulu last Friday for a meal and drinks with 4 friends. I was initially impressed by the decor which has Vegas-like extravagance. From there on, it was down hill.\n\nRestaurant:\n\nThe food was very overpriced and poorly executed. The meats were not seasoned well and were over-cooked and chewy. Either because none of us enjoyed it particularly or because we had over-ordered we didn't end up finishing alot of it. The first bottle of wine we ordered was pretty bad. We told the waitress when one of us tasted it that we didn't like it, but she didn't seem to know what to do and just looked at us blankly. \n\nService was generally slow. It took 25 minutes for our drink orders to arrive and when it did arrive, they arrived sporadically, so some people had their drinks and others did not. They forgot to give us a dessert we had ordered, but only afterwards did we realise that they still charged us £12 for it. The meal cost the 5 of us £560 and was memorable only for being disappointing: average, but expensive food and bad service.\n\nClub:\n\nAfterwards, we stayed for the club. The atmosphere was lively and they had a live drum player that added some additional charm. However, the night was once again let down by poor staff. I won't bother with all the annoying incidences that accumulated during the night, but I will give two that really annoyed me.\n\nOne of the bartenders at the 'Champagne Bar' seemed to be only serving girls. After waiting 15-20 minutes and seeing him serve any girl group that came over, I asked him why he was serving other people when he knew I should be next. He said (bizarrely candidly) \"You know, ladies first. They're pretty girls...Come on, you'd do the same.\" \n\nWhen I went downstairs with the drink I had just bought, I spent a minute trying to re-find my friends by the escalators. A bouncer angrily came over and demanded that I either get on to the dance floor or go back upstairs. I told him that I just wanted to find my friends before I go onto the dance floor or I'll spill the four drinks I was holding. He said that he didn't care. I moved to the outskirts of the dancefloor (literally next to everyone dancing) when he came back over and said \"Do you want me to throw you out? I said get ONTO the dancefloor\". I naturally spilled a lot of it on my hands and shoes.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis is indicative of the type of service at Shaka Zulu. Bouncers are angry, rude and dismissive. Bar staff are slow and/or unprofessional. Their prices will make you think that they're a premium establishment, but if you believe that, you'll believe Camden Town is actually Cape Town. I honestly could have bought a single plane ticket to South Africa for what I spent in Shaka Zulu. Don't waste your money."

We had the crocodile cigars which were really good, followed by the steak - which was cooked perfectly and melted in the mouth, and the chocolate tart after. \n\nAll was great and we struggled to find fault. There was live African music performed throughout the restaurant which was great. The only fault we could have made was that we didn't have much of a break inbetween courses. \n\nI'd definitely recommend, we had a great evening. "

Although the entertainment is first class, the venue, staff and beer are all very very poor.\n\nI met up with 6 friends and we love the Elvis monthly club when we can make it.\n\nHaving only two bar tenders on a night that has been booked out in advance seems like the pub knows you will stay all night because you are booked in and they will cut staffing cost without any care for the customers.\n\nThe staff in question have little or no customer service qualities. Waiting to be served is quite an ordeal,stools around the bar take up so much room that you find yourself standing in the middle of the dance floor waiting to be served.\n\nI wont be going to another Elvis Saturday at the venue for these reasons. I think the management needs to have a good look at themselves in the mirror as they seem to think they can run a function night on 2 staff.\n\nThe beer, . The ale is of poor quality. Not only did each ale run out in quick succession, it was obvious that it was not kept well and not enough was ordered.\nAle drinking in this venue was very poor. I expected to try a pint of each of the 4 or 5 ales on tap but only 2 pints were of drinkable quality which quickly ran out.The other taps consisted of some kind of cloudy dark matter that I gave back to the barman and asked for a different drink.\nCoke and lemonade ran out. I tried to order vodka and coke and was told they had ran out of all mixers. The bar woman had no personality and looked like she did not want to be there one bit. \n\nI don't know how it is thru the week, but I will never waste another minute of my time at the hands of these amateurs at the weekend again. \n"

After a little thumb twiddling we were indeed greeted by the 'man with the clipboard' who gave us our wristbands and we were on our way.\n\nLittle did we know that inside we were to be met by a queue for the coats that was treble that of the one outside. We spent the next 30 maybe 45 minutes waiting to hand our coats in half expecting to see a lone monkey scratching his a**e behind the counter. When we got to the front there was actually a team of three people somehow managing to put away about 1 coat every 5 minutes. ABSOLUTELY INSANE!\n\nLayout was a little strange to say the least, in order to get to rooms 2 & 3 you had to fight your way to the front of the main room. This room was packed out, so for this reason and mainly better tunes were being played in room 2 that's were we spent the duration of our night.\n\nErgh boys put on some quality sounds, but the sound system has a lot to be desired. Audio was all top end and barely any bass at all, through out the club. Crowd was friendly, only saw one incident of aggression at the beginning of the night.\n\nA lot of people mention the door staff being rather unfriendly which i didn't have a problem with but once your in there they will treat you like your Pablo Escobar. Staring, and loitering around you on the dance floor (maybe i've just got one of those faces).\n\nGreat night, great music, great crowd, alright club. \n"

My experience was a good one! We had a few drinks, chilled out and then hit a few other bars. The next night, which was my last I thought we would head back again. While there I bought a bottle of Champaign and they offered to put us in the VIP room. Was a very nice gesture so we went ahead and did that. They also brought over a huge group of girls (I was with 3 other guys) so that worked out well also! All in all, I never had a problem in the 2 times I went. I am headed back to London next summer and plan on hitting Club 49 a few nights during my stay. I am rather looking forward to it to be honest. Have those bottles ready! "

The people at the door are not only rude but they want to charge you more than they are they suppose to.

Suddenly African looking bouncer come over and asked who has bought drink from out side. No buddy knew what he was talking about. Then he started pushing my friends and said move down this is a VIP area. It is only for VIP's. One of my friend decided to talk to manager. I personally asked manager a question why we are not allowed to sit in VIP. There was no answer from manager. Instead of solving problem manager got things violent. \n\nManager had smile on his face in this critical situation instead of being serious. What me and my friend wanted from manager was an explanation. This incident bought down the whole experience of the place. \n\nManager needs to talk to guest instead of bouncers and focus on his job. Manager needs to take control of the situation, know what is the actual situation and know what is the question guest is asking.\n\nSoho is a very competitive location for bars. Bar could have made lot of money out of us. But instead manager got us all kicked out and we had to spend all our money in other bar.\n\nI will never ever go back to this place. \n"

After lots of back and forth with the booking staff, a daytime visit and an evening visit I finally decided to book a couple of tables in the Milk room, which was the more upmarket room and a bit more chilled than the main dance floor.\n\nOn the night everything ran like clockwork. The drinks I pre-ordered were well priced, chilled, and delivered to the table when asked. The sharing platters were much better than expected (sliders, mini fish and chips etc). The girls liked the music and spent their time between the Milk room (house/dance) and the adjoining room (R&B) but were less keen on the disco room which was a bit cheesier and seemed to be full of birthdays and hen parties. All rooms were lively and the choice of music makes it a good venue for groups.\n\nThe staff in the Milk room were excellent and both Andy (assistant manager?) and Maz (Manager?) checked in on us regularly to make sure all was ok. The bar staff were great too and the bar was pretty efficiently run which is not always the case in a central London club!\n\none piece of advice...take your ID. Most of our group were asked on the door despite being between 28-35 years old. It's not really a problem, and should be expected in most Central London clubs, but better safe than sorry."

However, 3 days later the credit card was charged for the full amount of roughly £450.\n\nEnquiries made by our party organizer fell on deaf ears, to the extent that management eventually refused to take her calls. They refused to accept any responsibility and further implied that our friend was lying. Disgusting!\n\nHave a look at other reviews on this page and I think you'll struggle to find many positives about Proud Cabaret.

There were several groups in the same situation as ourselves on the night I visited. Even though I spoke to the manager and explained the situation he said there was nothing they could do to let our guests in, so we had no choice but to leave and try and find another venue at 10pm on a Saturday. Poor poor service."

          "text": "Last night (3/4/11) I went down to East Village to witness a rare dj set from one of my favourite artists, Erykah Badu. The first dodgy thing to happen was the cloakroom attendants attempt to place my coat on the same hanger as my friends but charge us for 2 (why charge for two if it's on one hanger: so she can pocket half the money). This didn't bother me until we realised that while trying to buy a drink at the bar she had given a fake £10 note to my mate. This was returned with no apology. This actually shadows in comparison to what happened next. \n\nThroughout the night I had spent most of my time standing at the back enjoying the music. As a working DJ myself I like to see what other pieces of tech DJ's use. So I meandered my way to the front to have a look. I found myself standing next to an all dancing and rapping bouncer who seemed more like a member of the crowd than security. The next thing I feel to my dismay is the securities fat fingers jabbing me (4-5 times in quick concession) in the back, these actually felt more like a punches with the amount of force he put into them. So I then turn around to hear him say, \"Move outta the way, your blocking the girls view.\" I in turn say, \"no. Where do you expect me to go. If move anywhere I won't be able to see and I'll just be blocking somebody elses view.\"(I feel he was just angry as I was standing between him and the girls) He then says,\"ok we'll see.\" So he calls security who then come and tell me I have to leave. So I say, \"for what?\" He then drags me through the middle of the dance floor. I then try and stop him as I dont want to be dragged through the the crowd like I've done something wrong as this can only tarnish a reputation. Then another two security grab me. One grabs my legs and another gets me in a head lock, not the restraining type but the type that flattens your throat and stops air being breathed. I then find myself outside, where my wishes to speak with the manager to complain about the incident were met by dead ears.\nNothing like this has happened to me before I am a peaceful and loving human being who frequents the dance floor and decks on the scene around London and have never been treated with such disrespect. What a humiliating and Embarrassing night. East Village is DEFINITELY a club I will not be visiting again."

It has gone from dirty downstairs venue to smartly finished (except the 80's disco floor). Unfortunately, this means they think they have become some sort of exclusive, highly sought after venue. Let's not forget it's still Digress and its still a depressing place to grab a drink after work. \n\nThere are now bouncers roaming around the place looking for people to intimidate and offend for inexplicable and unnecessary reasons. Incidentally, don't dare to think you could possibly put your bag on the side by the booths, the bouncer will storm over and strong arm you into putting it in the cloakroom, because it is making the place untidy. However, the scantily clad 80's disco roller skating girls (I know what you're hoping and no they can't get away with it because they aren't attractive) that look absurd aren't having the same effect?! \n\nThe absurdly loud music means that it's ideal if you want to have that awkward conversation with a colleague whereby you've no idea what they've just said and you nod and smile.. It feels like it's 2am when really it's just turned 6pm, in that it's far too loud, drunken, scummy and yet still pretentious - and quite frankly you're tired and bored of it.\n\nThis place is horrendous. Overpriced. Pretentious without substance. Dingy underground bar, probably only acceptable if you and your friends lack any taste. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n"

But unfortunately we were very disappointed when we arrived, it was not very busy and we just walked in – so no point in having the said tickets. Drinks are very expensive in here and not that great, but they have done outstanding work with the decor, upstairs is small, but once you make your way to the downstairs bit – its massive – with two separate bars located at the bottom will make for speedy service. If you want decent cocktails I would suggest going somewhere else, but for a quick drink after work this place will suffice. "

          "text": "All in all, if you are into the electronic music scene this is a \"must-go-to\" club. All though prices are high, the crowd and music make up for it. (click more to read on)\n\nUnless you hate the genres; House, Deep-House, Techno, Electro and Dance - please disregard the other reviews \"hating\" on the music and crowd\n\nThe music is the closest one can get to underground before you get to \"word of mouth\" gigs and such. All the music in its rooms are quite original, and many of the tracks - though taken from existing tracks have been uniquely changed, modified to each individual DJ - as they should be. And as for the crowd, well I have been going regularly for over 5 months and never once found myself upset or in and argument with the people there. In honesty they are all friendly and after a good time. \n\nAdmittedly the door price is quite high, but you must take into consideration that all of the revenue generated by the entrance is divided between the DJs.\nUnlike a normal club playing pop music and such, visiting a club like this is like going to a concert, none of the music is the same and in most situations the music we are dancing to is being mixed on the spot. Therefore it is understandable that the only way Egg makes its revenue is through its sale of beverages and food. (that's right - they have a mini cantine)\n\nThe security are of course going to search and pat you down. But which club wouldn't? This club is in the centre of London and welcomes some of the biggest underground DJs in the UK. It would be an error in their judgement to not search people should they be trying to bring in weapons or drugs.\n\nI wouldn't say the staff are rude, but when you're standing at one of the bars alongside a host of 50 other people, I can imagine it gets quite stressful.\n\nIf there is anything wrong with the club I would say the lack of a good air-con, the very expensive price of drinks that are really do not hold much value. ie £5-6 for a can of red label. Red Label is terrible, i could by that else were for less than a quid. again £3-4 for a bottle of water - bit extortionate (thought they have a jug of water at every bar)\n"

The staff wasn't particularly welcoming, body search is systematic.\n\nEntrance price is £25, drinks are very expensive (£10 for a double vodka and Red Bull, £5.50 for a can of Red Stripe, £4 for a simple bottle of water).\n\nThe music is very repetitive and gets boring. While the club stays open until the morning, we just left out of boredom."

I'm quite new to the house scene but have been told that Egg is quite up there in terms of house clubs, so was super excited to go. I was told there was a student guestlist, which offered cheaper tickets prices, and so emailed Kelly Nichols the Student Liaison Officer and asked her to put mine and my friend's name on the guestlist. She emailed me back saying we were on the guestlist and as long as we got there before 1am it'd cost us £8 to get in. We got to Egg at 12.45am and were told that tix were £20 each and there was no student guestlist. Upon showing the lady at the tills my emails from Kelly she said we could pay £15 to come in but there wasn't a student guestlist on Tuesdays and we wouldn't be able to get in for less as there was a top (more like unknown) DJ playing.\nI wouldn't have minded paying extra if I hadn't been told otherwise and if the club was popping but the club looked dead, and there was hardly anyone in there.\nSearch wise- We were pat searched and made to go through a metal detector. I had a packet of chewing gum confiscated from me! \nAll in all not a pleasant night for me. Next time I think I'll just go to Fabric tbh! \nFYI not everyone is on alcohol, as upon leaving the club me and my friend were approached by a guy selling balloons and crystals outside, so if alcohol is not your drug of choice, then I'm sure you'll find something that is!"

Some I did like very much. What's great about this place, is the fact that if you know someone from the Iced-lands of north, then on some days, the cocktails are almost 1/3 of the price. Now who can say no to that. So find a Nordic friend and head on down there. Oh!! one more thing.. the music is a bit on the loud side. "

When I asked if I could get those four quid as a discount for a bottle of wine they rejected it and instead offered me a beer. I don't drink beer, and decided not to drink anything else either at Nordic bar.\n\nThe meatballs tasted like meatballs, the Kopparbergs ciders tasted like Kopparbergs cider.. ..so just get it somewhere, anywhere, but here..

Basically, you go to Soho, take 3 random guys with cheap wigs, take them to a flat somewhere with a 5£ Ikea light, and you will have the same show.\n\nEverything was poor , there was no food available inside (no crisps, no peanuts), the microphone was loud and kept making weird noises.\n\nYou should never waste yourmoney there (even if I booked it half price on Lastminute, I am still disappointed)"

The bar is always busy but luckily there's an upstairs and downstairs bar so you're never waiting too long for a drink. \n\nThere's usually a DJ on a Friday night who generally plays chart music with the odd old school classic RnB song. There is of course a small dance floor which is usually packed full of people but there's always room for one more.\n\nThis is a good place to meet friends for a couple of drinks, its reasonably priced and a good start to a Friday night.\n\n"

As we reached early so asked by bouncer to came back 11PM and need to stand in the queue. I was on the guest list and waited for more than half and an hour in the queue as we were two male friends so in the end not allowed to enter. It's not because we were not allowed to enter, but the lady was extremely rude on the door. Just because we haven't got the bloody membership so they have no right to insult other people. My point is that why at the first place they put us on the guest list, and even the bouncer didn't inform us that male without women are not allowed to enter as we were clearly made aware of our situation."

The club is very crowded on the Saturdays and dancing on the aisles, between the tables, is also another thing that may be not that pleasant if you are not with a big group of friends and just get smashed and do not care about the rest! I love the music though..so I am definitely going to visit it again, real soon and see what happens this time."

For a Thursday night out it was £20 cover charge for guys to get in but girls go free before 11. Due to the number of people you bring it may be more economical to get a table at these clubs. For a table you get a number of \"chalices\". These consist of a large quantity of fruit juice with long straws and sparklers served in a very large vase. Designed for 10 people to share you can empty out a little someone more potent too. It is an expensive night out but if you're not doing it too often and have money to burn then it's worth it."

          "text": "Awful experience from an establishment run by awful people. \n\nI had booked a table for 4 early on Friday morning for the same evening. Arrived on time to be told from the man on the door where to go (not being shown the table or anything). When I found the table myself, it was more like a small stool, with 3 small chairs around it. This was a table booked for food and drink! You could barely fit one plate on it. We then had to search ourselves for another chair. \n\nWe weren't told how anything worked, how my £25 deposit was to be used, and it took approximately 20 minutes to order food when we were told what to do (after having to continuously fetch someone and we were just directed to our tiny table, nothing more). When ordering food the woman at the bar had to ask her supervisor to take the order because she did not know how to order the food. Above all, I had a 50% off card which was not accepted despite this being an establishment part of the deal and despite the woman who I booked with on the phone confirming the 50% card (Gourmet Society) and that there were no problems with that. \n\nThe food THEN took approximately 30 minutes for some very small and overpriced burger platters, only after the wrong food was brought to our table 5 minutes before. Another chair had to be brought over the put the rest of our food on it also! \n\nAll in all, extremely rude, unhelpful staff and management who had a) no idea what they were doing and b) no idea how to deliver good customer service. At the end I had to ask where my £25 deposit went, because there was no breakdown of food on the bill, just a final price, and no mention of it. Again, this was time consuming as the rest of the experience at the Jewel. \n\nI urge people not to go here, but to instead try one of the other bars or restaurants in Covent Garden. The atmosphere in the Jewel wasn't nice, the music was also too loud. \n\nAWFUL EXPERIENCE! AVOID THIS PLACE! "

          "text": "My friend booked a table at Club Cirque le Soir on Friday 17th October. One member of the group arrived at 11pm, and was told the table was available but she had to return with the card holder who made the table booking. Once the card holder returned we were told that there were no tables available and we would be provided with a refund. We then asked if we could just pay the £20 fee on the door and go in as regular guests, but we were told it was at the clubs discretion who they let in. Throughout this whole period, other people were arriving and were allowed access into the club, and one group of European were even given a table. I thought to myself, they just told us there were no tables available. I then started to realise we were not allowed in because we were black. I could not believe the blatant racism that was taking place. Our group consisted of three black girls and one mixed race girl, who were well dressed and well spoken. We are all professional women and were dressed far smarter than some of the other non-black people they allowed in. To add insult to injury, as we all proceeded to leave, the mixed race girl was called back and told only she would be allowed entry. So the moral of the story is that this is a racist club that exists in the heart of London. This club are promoting the likes of P. Diddy, Jay-Z and Kanye West attending their events yet they do not like Black people. After reading a few other reviews I see my group of friends were not the only black people subjected to this treatment. Absolutely disgraceful!"

I was shocked but not surprised, i don't go out in central London any more. I had to restrain our non black friends, they were totally angered at what they were hearing. 3 mixed race girls 2 europeans and 1 arab? and i still couldn't get in.... I laughed it off, imagine if I took my friends Loooool... Ive never had to beg someone to take my money, so we spent our hard earned money at Zebranos opposite LOL, your loss. We had a great night out, Can't recommend Zebranos highly enough, great food great company. they have there priorities right, they're only interested in the colour of my money."

NO! get to the front she asks what guest list are you on, (luckily we had made friends with a promotor and she told us to quote her name and we'll be fine) The woman on the door was SOOOO RUDE full of ATTITUDE, a horrible tone! 'who's jasmine? I don't know no jasmine theres no guest list for jasmine! its a no tonight!' Fine, I still accepted that we weren't allowed in, but I wanted to ask the women at the door what do i have to do to avoid this happening AGAIN! The bouncer man would not let me talk to the woman and just ask such a simple question that could be easily answered with 'come on a week day' or what ever reason it is! BUT NO THESE RUDE WOMEN and BOUNCERS (Who actually pushed me, because I was trying to get the womans attention!!!) AND to top it off, I finally got a womans attention to ask her what do i have to do for next time to get in, she literally walked away from me mid sentence when she realised I wasn't asking her how much is it to buy a table!! Horrible Horrible Horrible women with NO MANNERS at all!! You can still talk to people with a bit of respect and courtesy!

It took nearly an hour to have our drinks delivered and then another hour to pay for them. By midnight they were trying to clear out the place. A horrific evening. Just don't go."

I thought it was just me and my un-hip anorak that was getting the cold shoulder, but several people to whom I mentioned the establishment volunteered the same opinion. Shame, because the pub plays decent music and has an unpretentious atmosphere aside from that. \n\nObviously it's overpriced and the urinals drip all night until visiting the lavatory requires aquaplaning, but this is Camden Town we're talking about."

Its knowledgeable bartenders offer great drinks recommendations and make sure you will get to know new drinks that match your taste.\n\nWhen I was looking for a suitable bar for a first date, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to finally check out Purl in Marylebone. I was lucky, I walked in in the early evening to book two places for later - and surprisingly they still had two spots by the bar. But you should really book a few days in advance, as it seems to be busy most of the time. And I guess, since Chiltern Firehouse became quite popular recently, Purl might be even busier than it already was before.\n\nAs it goes, I spent a good half an hour waiting, which was fine, because sitting at the bar, you can chat to the bartenders and also just watch them do their thing - always fascinating. \n\nAfter starting off with a white wine, I soon moved over to cocktails. I looked through the menu, and then asked the bartender for recommendendations - after specifying a few basics (gin!), he came up with some suggestions. \n\nThe first cocktail was not too complicated, but very fresh and delicious. The second or third then was a more advanced drink. It came in two parts that I had to mix together myself. A brilliant idea, but my tipsy, clumsy self managed to break the glass in the mixing process, so that one did not go down too well. However, the embarrassment was manageable and overall, we really had a nice evening with excellent cocktails at Purl. \n\nIf you enjoy tasty cocktails in a relaxed, dimly lit environment mixed by experts, Purl is definitely a place for you.\n\n"

When questioned they said it was home made so not very fizzy, and were generally a bit..... Ordered something else which was £11 and the size of the cocktail was tiny, which was a theme with all drinks we had. No issues spending that much on a cocktail if it has a good portion of booze in, and when compared to somewhere like Nightjar the value for money here is definitely lacking. Also ordered sausage rolls which were ice cold in the middle. Generally not a positive experience from a drink, food or customer experience point of view.\n\n"

As a member one has to pay over £300 per year for entry but one can be denied entrance by the doormen anytime. Last night (Friday, May 30, 2014) the club refused entry to members claiming it to be a celebrity only night.\n\nTheir website provides no details about the entry policy. The phone is only an answering machine where one can leave a message. The best the members can do is - go to the club and try their luck to be allowed entry. \n\nI wonder what the club is charging for? Is it to entertain women and celebrities at the expense of its paying gay member? \n\nThe least the management can do is to send out emails to its member telling them when they are not allowed entry, for what reason, and how they are going to be compensated for it. \n\nThe membership is valid for 1 year. There is no information about any compensation for the time it was shut. \n\nI hope the owners of the club wake up soon.... otherwise they will lose the remaining members too. "

Here, I have always felt welcome and comfortable!\n\nTucked away down a side street off the strand, it is often nicely quiet, especially for an afternoon drink. The draft beers are cheap for central London, and there is even a (small) wine selection if you fancy something fancier.\n\nMy only issue is the toilets up the steep steps, but that's only because they become a slight challenge once you've had one or two. The upstairs bar is usually closed during the day, then open for private hire or themed events in the evenings. The downstairs bar is quite small, but cosy, and a great array of posters and memorabilia on the walls. I approve of the music choices too!\n\nFriendly, easy on the wallet, good company. What's not to love!"

There'd be a song that really got you going, but it would often follow up with a soft track that would just bring the dance to a halt.\n\nI did like that it was small and not too packed out that you'd struggled to get a drink or get to the toilet.

Food was okay, the music was just okay. You have to be drunk to enjoy it as it is not loud enough to be proper club (eventhough they are club) and not good choice.

We had made a booking a few days ago because it was a restaurant suggested by friends and having visited Rextail the week prior, I expected to have a delightful experience. Before I start, I will say the food was delicious, despite the portions being absolutely tiny and not quite enough to fill a grown man.\n\nOn arriving, we were taken to a seat with our coats still on; no one had offered to take our coats to the cloakroom and I actually had to ask if the restaurant even had a cloakroom. \n\nSecondly, I would like to mention that when we were booking, we mentioned that we had specific dietary requirements and the person on the phone assured us that they requirements would be met. On arriving, we decided to double check just to be sure and this time, we were told that our dietary requirements could not be catered to, essentially restricting us to two meat options on the entire menu.\n\nAnyway, we did decide to go ahead and order what we could, despite having thoughts of walking out at that point. The waitress who was serving us seemed extremely grumpy and did not seem like someone who wanted to be at the job. \n\nThere were tiny details as well that were ignored. For example, upon arriving, no one took the effort to pull the chairs out or place the napkin in place or even smile. Throughout the entire meal, we had to fill our glasses ourselves and when the jug was empty, no one came to refill it. The one point we were asked if the meal was okay was once we had finished everything and the waitress arrived to take the meal away. I understand a lot of these details are tiny, but for a restaurant in Mayfair, the bar is set extremely high and the prices we pay for the food and service need to be justified too.\n\nOn finishing our meal, although my friend mentioned during the reservation that the meal is for a birthday, there was no sign of the staff knowing anything about this.\n\nIt was an extremely disappointing experience for me and it is such a letdown for a birthday experience and on the way back, my friend who was treating me felt extremely embarrassed having taken me to what she proclaimed was one of the worst restaurant experiences in her life.\n\nOn e-mailing the manager with a complaint, after one e-mail, she has also not bothered to reply back, which shows that on principle, this is not a restaurant worth visiting."

Seemed to me that the place tries to re-create some of the \"posh\" Moscow places (tough bouncers at the entrance instead of a smiling hostess), where everyone looks at what you are dressed into, etc. The place just looked surreal to me. The prices bite. The food is worth perhaps 1/2 of the price. Some dishes were cold when served, some too salty. The pasta tasted like it was cooked awhile ago. Some of the seafood dishes were nice and simple. The bread and the drinks were top class. Some of the Russian public reminded me with their attitude of the times when I was myself working in some top class Moscow restaurants as a student, and I certainly did not want to see this kind of attitude in London when I brought my business partners for a dinner. Reminded me Moscow 15 years ago, where the only important thing is the size of your wallet. "

The staff were lovely but were so overworked that they couldn't keep up with the demands of the customers. Also, they hardly understood English, which delayed food times, orders came out incorrect and they struggled to deal with all the commotion. A restaurant to demand the prices it does in Mayfair, should provide each table area with a designated waiter and food staff to ensure they are given the excellent service they are paying for. We were served by more than 10 different staff members - this says it all.\n\nFood was okay but not worth the price. My fellow diner and I ordered pasta off menu. Seafood Pasta so no biggy you would think! Considering their most expensive pasta on the menu was spaghetti and clams at £26, it was hard to swallow the bill when we saw our dish was priced at £52.50, yes £52.50!!!! Double the price, which equated to 3 prawns and a crayfish or two. What was even more disappointing though, when we queried the price, was that the general manager made no appearance to justify the cost, even though his waitress admitted making a mistake by not giving us a price at the point of order. The manager insisted though, via his waitress, that the price would stay because the price of the pasta, even though I made the point that he would lose a customer....really??!!\n\nWould not recommend at all."

Got in fine, enjoyed my drink and then went outside for a smoke, leaving my jacket with wallet, ID and phone inside the club with my boyfriend and all our friends.\n\nAfter wanting to come back in after my smoke the bouncers refused me entry back in the club claiming I had never entered in the first place, I said I had organized a private event for my boyfriends birthday and that the manager could confirm that this was true. The bouncer made some snide remark about how the manager wouldn't let gays in anyway and proceeded to tell me to piss off and that if I had got in then I would have a stamp.I refused to budge stating I had been in and my jacket was still inside, justifying why I was wearing a whole suit without the jacket. I was told I was a liar and that people like me weren't wanted inside. I felt very intimidated and could sense the bouncers wanting to provoke me into doing something. When another of my friends arrived for the party asking why I was stuck outside the bouncers also refused him entry because he was associated with myself and accused me of wanting to incite more trouble. It wasn't until my boyfriend came out looking for me that I was able to claim my jacket, the bouncers proceeded to speak with the manager in front of us saying we had been causing trouble claiming we had been making homophobic comments against the bouncers even though we were the homosexuals! We all got kicked out/asked to leave by the manager and told we weren't welcome here anymore and not to come back again. This all happened before 9pm too.\n\nI've always enjoyed opal but the bouncers have ruined the entire experience for me. the lack of compassion, the surplus of arrogance and aggression. communication between bouncers and management was nonexistent. Be careful here, the bouncers are more interested in creating trouble than keeping order. I'm still waiting for an apology from management about the whole incident. Avoid like the plague, stick to fire and heaven clubs."

          "text": "I went to the Opal bar for a friends birthday this weekend. All tables had already been reserved so there was nowhere to stand but at the bar. As you can imagine this became impractical as the evening progressed and the bar became more crowded.\n\nIt took a huge amount of time to get served which I could understand if this were a particularly busy bar, however when I arrived and it was still quite empty there seemed to be staff standing around ignoring people waiting to buy a drink.\n\nOpal bar has one redeeming factor that is half price drinks before 9pm. But when you consider that a pint of beer will cost you at least £5 after 9pm, I can see why the place emptied out so quickly after the drinks offer had finished.\n\nI was also appalled at the behaviour of staff when my sister's coat was stolen from the bar. My question is, is it normal policy to eject a girl into the rain when she becomes distraught over the theft of her coat? The manager on duty at the time refused to help out at all and wouldn't even check over CCTV footage to see whether it was actually stolen or whether it had just been misplaced. \n\nOverall I'd have to say my experience of the Opal Bar was pretty awful and I certainly won't be spending my money there again. Based on the behaviour of the staff I have also informed all of my friends and acquaintances that they should find better places to part with their money."

Avoid at all costs if you want to avoid aspiring Made in Chelsea extras.

I thought it was a bit steep but agreed. Only on the night was it revealed to me that the table cost £400 and it came with two bottles of either vodka or champagne. This was not at all what I had agreed with the manager. When I asked him via email if anything was included with the table I wasn't told that there was. The manager was really rude to me and didn't seem to want to take the £400 I was willing to pay in there. He was adamant that all the big clubs charge £600-£1000 for a table and I was lucky to get one for £400 with two bottles of something. In the end he said to his bar manager 'do whatever makes her happy' and was very dismissive of me. I'd go back there, but don't bother trying to book anything. Bar staff were nice and friendly though. "

This really goes against the spirit of Karaoke and kinda ruined the night for us as we were mainly going to have a night out and have a light night of singing etc. Needless to say we won't be going back, and if you like Karaoke this isn't the place to do that, go find a small pub with a real Karaoke setup and real people.

The house wine was awful and was served luke warm in carafes - it had to go back and was replaced by more that was only slightly cooler. Expensive sharing cocktails are also available complete with sparklers and giant straws. If you are going you are probably safest sticking with pizza which is nothing more than average, but preferable to the tiny portion of main you may get otherwise. Throughout the night the waiting staff break into choreographed dance routines to loud music. Funny the first time was wears a bit thin. Towards the end of the meal you felt under pressure to give up table for the next sitting. Entertainment around the bar takes the form of a seriously bad singer who claimed to do 'covers of pop songs and takes requests', yet knew none of the songs we asked for which were far from out of the ordinary. The night descends into karaoke upstairs until 2am. "

If you want good (but not amazing) Italian food and cocktails in a laid back, kitschy vibe then visit Monday - Thursday. It's a good, lively night out. However, if you are more focused on the booze and a crazy weekend, book in for brunch! At £35 a head, that covers all your food (again, not the best food) and all your prosecco for 2.5 hours. Prosecco. On tap. For 2.5 hours. That alone is worth more than the £35 cover charge! Everyone gets very drunk, very quickly and the karaoke and dancing are hilarious. A great choice for a birthday party as it takes the fuss out of splitting bills and having to organise a place to dance after dinner.\n\nBottom line: If loud music and drunk people before 5pm is your idea of hell - avoid this place. However, if you are looking for a raucous and very fun day out - Bunga Bunga brunch is hard to beat. (Side note - use the cloakroom, belonging do tend to go missing if left in the restaurant area when everyone is dancing)"

The club has a good size and it is distributed in different areas with different types of music. They offer the possibility to prepare private venues such as hen parties or birthday packages. Personally, when I went there the club area was too crowded except from that it is a good place to meet with friends in central london. "

Drinks were fairly pricey (£4.40 for a bottle of peroni) but I would expect to pay that, the barstaff were quite nice and the music was pretty good. What really annoyed me was one of the bouncers. A few of us were waiting patiently to get our coats back and a bouncer just came along and started pushing people around. The guy was a complete idiot on a massive power trip."

The door staff, security and 'mangers' are condescending, rude and have a lack of customer care. They were painfully unhelpful and ruthless. I arranged a minibus from East London for my friends, weeks leading up to Saturday 1st February my friends and myself had contacted their head office and checked the website FAQs regarding purchasing tickets and dress code, this was a well-planned night out and all the boxes were ticked. My male friends, with pre paid tickets and adhering to the dress code on the website which states ‘fairly relaxed dress code’ but ‘we don’t allow things like sportswear or anything you’d throw on to go to the gym or for a run’ were refused entry because there footwear. They were wearing Creative Recreations, Ralph Lauren and Prada. People were seen entering with battered Converse, Nike Blazers and Hierarchies. Having challenged the ‘manager’ Lee about his decision to not allow my friends in because of their non-gym running shoes, he told us all to wait until he could deal with us. It also seemed that people who had pre paid tickets were getting the most hassle for their footwear. Lee and Elliot (door staff) continued to repeat that the club needed standards and insisted that this dress code was clear but nowhere does is it state on the ticket or website that the footwear they had on was unacceptable or that Converse and Vans were ok. Once we got in, an hour and 30mins later, I was shocked to find queues for the other rooms. Which meant your experience was concentrated to one room, so no value for money going to a large club. I waited at the bar for nearly 10/15mins and was then told no card, there were no signs to say cash only. Time wasted, the night was emotionally exhausting and a huge let down, would not recommend this for a friends big night out as there is no guarantee you will all get in. Three of my party did not get in, and ended up getting a cab all the way back to East London which cost them £70. They were wearing Prada and Ralph Lauren (non gym wear). My friend changed into a pair of old once white converse and was let in, where were the standards there? There is no consistency, clarity or professionalism which is really unacceptable from a club that professes high standards."

But no, soon as we got to the entrance, the front staff refused entry straight away. They said my shoes were classified as boot (Timberlands) and they were not allowed in. I was furious as people wearing similar shoes were allowed in but they didn't allow me and my Gf.. What made me even more angry that one of the staff actually said to me and I quote ''If you go out and buy £6 Converse trainers I would let you in but not with those boots''. They really do need to sort something out. Paid £27 each for tickets and a cab drive there and back £40 (nearly hundred £s even before we even got in the club). No where in the tickets it says that classic timberland boots are not allowed. Could have made it a bit more clearer.. I have a feeling they were only letting certain groups of people in and not everyone. Even if you paid £££s you will be very lucky to get in the club.. \n\nI have actually been to that club wearing the same shoes couple of months back and they allowed me then so now I don't know what had happened.. \n\nWas reading a lot of reviews on Google, most people also agreed that it will be hard to get in even when you have done the right things (bought tickets in advance and wearing proper clothes) but I thought it would never happen to me. Guess I was wrong.. \n\nOne NYE night out ruined thanks to Oceana."

The dance floor filled up fast and you can't *really* dance after about 10:30 pm but that first hour is good.\n\nThe courtyard is a nice place to cool off and actually chat with someone. Forget talking in the dance area the music is so loud it is literally impossible to do anything more than read lips."

A very kind Indian man greeted us before he even had a chance to walk over to reception on our first night with smiles and enthusiasm. The next morning was a different story as we went back to reception and had to pretty much get the attention of the British woman who seemed as if she was ready to finish her shift and couldn't be bothered, making me automatically feel like we had overstayed our welcome. The restaurant staff, I cannot fault. They were so friendly and receptive to any questions I'd wish we only went to them for anything rather than reception. As for the bar staff, I would say was poor. She didn't seem to want to serve us in the first place and then when we asked for ice she seemed to be annoyed. We came back again the second night for more ice and she gave us a kind of \"oh you again\" attitude. We stayed in a double room which was very nice. Our first night we ate in the restaurant there and the food was delicious. The deal we had included breakfast buffet which is just your regular full-english breakfast. Overall the hotel was lovely and I would recommend it to others. Just make sure not to ask the bar staff for anything... or maybe just ice! ;-)"

I thought that the idea of having a swimming pool in a night club was great idea. The drinks were cheap and there were great deals on cocktails and entry. The engergy in the club was electric. The security staff are well orgainsed and did their job accordingly. I recommend this night club to everyone. It's a must visit venue."

This gives it an awful atmosphere and despite it being very late in the night, it was completely dead. The fact that it was so old and tatty made it seem the huge prices for drinks and admission were absolutely ridiculous.\n\nHowever, this was NOT the the worst part. A few of us decided to walk out of the club for a bit of fresh air. On doing this, the bouncer said we weren't allowed back in; we had paid £12 entry literally ten minutes before! One of my other friends then also came out to talk to us and was actually in the parameters of the club. The bouncer then grabbed him and man-handled him out of the perimeter where he wasn't allowed back in either (he had only stood there for 30 seconds)! We felt like we had been CONNED; being denied access for simply stepping out the club is insane. I then started asking him why he wasn't letting us back in, (especially when there wasn't anyone inside anyway) his only reply was to rudely sigh, tut, and then turn his back and walk into the club's doorway. He clearly couldn't give me a good reason, we had not been rowdy or done anything wrong (it would have been impossible having been in there for a mere ten minutes!), we had simply stepped out of the club. Then as we walked away, in frustration I said to him this was \"the worst club ever\", he told me to \"f**k off you s**t\" - terrible, awful, and appalling standard of professionalism. \n\nIn summary, AVOID Aquarium like the plague; tacky nightclub, rude and unreasonable bouncers and overpriced drinks and admission. Don't make the same mistake we did and throw your money into this hole for only fifteen minutes worth of entry! It is easily the worst nightclub I have ever had the misfortune of going to. "

We found the hotel offered everything you could want.\n\nBased only two minutes from the M4 but far enough away that it didnt feel like a service station hotel. The hotel offers extremely good service and amazing facilities. The leisure facilities are very good (good sized pool, sauna etc) but they always say the little things are the best. The two stand out extras for me was free soft drinks in the mini bar in the room and Sky Sports 1,2 and 3 in the rooms!!! \n\nBreakfast was very good but we recommend eating out (nice little Indian down the road) as prices a little much for dinner at the hotel.\n\nThe reviews on here seem to be mixed but my experience was that this hotel offers elegance, facilities and extras for a very good price (£69.00 a night!)

However, I was disappointed when other attendees were not donning the same white clothes and robe as myself. I was forced to ask the rather awkward question of 'are you sacred of foreign intrusion' and to my dismay most people were not. Nevertheless, I persisted seeing as the name of the bar was so closely aligned to that of my society and ended up having a great time. I met some lovely new friends and will be coming back in the future. Bar staff were friendly and very welcoming. Only reason its not five starts is due to the initial confusion.\nKevin (With a brand new positive outlook on life!) - Obama 2016!"

The lunch menu is has lots of choice with various sushi, dim-sum type offerings, salads, tempura, bento boxes and 5-6 main dishes. I love the wild mushroom sushi, oh and the crab and scallop mushroom soup dumplings are delicious. For the main I always take a Bento box, last time it was the vegetarian one and the Bahn Trang rice paper rolls were amazing.

Seriously well presented, but as can be expected with such glamour, really small portions. I would say the quality of food was okay: good, but not great. Also, their menu was in Papyrus.

Yelling at customers to pay for entrance then to be told to hurrying up and enter the club and not to stand waiting for the rest of the group. *neglected as a child much?\n\nTo top it off, the drinks menu is way overpriced and nothing special at all. Beware, you will be served nothing but ice at £13 a pop.\n\nOverall the location is perfect, Bodo's Schloss-theme is cheap and tacky, especially when the female workers have to wear the Austrians outfit from Poundland...I would be extremely anal too if I have to wear the outfits for a living while showing hideous cellulite. \n\nNot really attractive darling!\n"

It's clear that the place is focused solely on making money. Set menu of £28 was way overpriced, and the food was average. Drinks were equally as expensive and the staff are unfriendly and rude. \nWe were all crammed onto one long table, and once we finished our meal (we were rushed into finishing 3 courses in about an hour and a half), they told us we had to move to the bar, where there was no space to stand. They then ushered in the next group of unsuspecting souls who will no doubt have received the same terrible service and dead average food.\n15% service charge was also extortionate. When I queried the service charge, I was told that \" yes it is optional for you, but if you don't pay it, someone else at your table will have to\". Also, it probably shouldn't be called 'service' charge when clearly there wasn't any proper service.\nThe place has such potential, but I won't be going back any time soon and wouldn't recommend it."

          "text": "Give this one a miss!! We went here on a whim as my friend had a taste-card(half price) and it was near by the oxford street shops. The interior decoration of this place is just plain bizarre! Everywhere was dimly lit with padded walls and incredibly kitsch snake skin furniture. The strangest was a display of feathered lamp shades hanging from the centre of the ceiling illuminated by bright blue lights.... why?! The strangely patterned wall paper on the stairs and odd perfume smell that lingered everywhere (over powering smell put me of my food) gave the place a brothel-esque vibe!\r\nI could have forgiven all of this if the food was good, however it was a disappointment. The sea bass was nice I will give them that, the lamb was bland and on top of stringy spinach with an odd taste. It was also accompanied by a limp looking dried out salad that would have looked sad in a bargain sandwich bought in a petrol station at 3am. For these kind of prices this should be fine dining and it was a LONG way from what I consider fine dining!\r\nThe worst offence though was the waiter pulling a fast one on us with the wine. We ordered a £30 bottle of pinot grigio, he then brought a bottle of pinot grigio to the table saying \"I should tell you we have a much better wine than the one you have chosen it is a little more expensive\" and we said \"No thank you we would like the wine we ordered\" he replied \"you want this one?\" making no indication it was actualy the more expencive one and we said \"yes\". The bill came and the wine was £38. We complained and he said, \"I told you the wine was more!\" -How deceptive and underhanded! We resentfully paid not wanting a fuss and both left feeling cheated and angry. Thank god we were only paying half price! The full bill was arond £120. If I had been forced to pay that for this experiance I would have cried myself to sleep! I'm certainly not going back and I advise you miss it out unless your curiosity to see colourfully lit lampshade displays over-powers you."

Reflex is a tacky hole in the wall and you will either love it or hate it because of this fact. Tucked away in the City it seems a little out of place but for a bar that’s stuck in a time warp I suppose any place is as good as another. \n\nWalking downstairs the neon and 80’s paraphernalia hits you right away and they do do their best to retain all of the 80’s glory. The patrons are a wide mix of ages, you are just as likely to be crooning ‘don’t stop believing’ next to an 18 year old who only knows the Glee version as a 50 year old who looks a bit bewildered to be out at 2am. This mix makes for a very interesting night! \n\nAll in all if you want to croon away to 80’s tracks and wear trainers into a club – this is probably the best and only place to do it. My only complaints are : The cocktails are disgusting. They are really, really not good. Stick to mixers or wine! \n\nYou may call me a purist… but I’m not the only one… because why in an 80’s bar does the DJ play music from the 70’s and 90’s? There is such a wealth of music from that decade, why do you need to dip into others? If you have a theme, stick to it! \n\nFor a tack-tastic night out – Reflex is going to be your jam. However, please make note there is next to no signal in the club so if you want to pre-book a taxi you will have to go outside before you intend to leave and then come back up. The taxi people outside will absolutely rip your off so pre-book and save your pennies. "

However, when we arrived we were assigned one waiter who was not quite experienced to host a large group. He arrived numerous times with drinks and did not remember the name of them and had to come back and forth from the bar to us to remember the name of the drinks. As for the food, the big disappointment was timing. Half of the orders arrived 30-40 min late! Half of the crowd was eating and the other half was waiting. It is unacceptable. And no one had any extra requests regarding their orders, very straight forward, and still the orders were mixed up! We had to chase the waiter and ask him several times to bring in the cake (that we brought to the restaurant). Again with a big delay, the cake arrived. When our guests asked for tea, they were served dirty cups which we had to return to the kitchen and ask to clean. \nOverall. customer service was very poor, we would say it was absent. We were quite disappointed with the way the guests are treated here taking into consideration the restaurant was notified 1 week in advance about a large group of people for the night. Unprofessional staff.\nFood and drinks were good, compliments to the chef and bartender. \nInterior was very nice.\n"

After informing the waitress and giving her back a sandwich, a small bowl of bacon (with out a sandwich) was brought to the table. When he asked for an actually sandwich his previous and now cold bacon-less sandwich was returned to him. Whilst he was eating the 2nd half of his cold sandwich he found a large hair. When he complained, he was told that as he had eaten most of it when he found the hair, he still had to pay. No manager was available to speak to about this shambles. \" others ordered a cheese burger, which arrive with no cheese. This was then taken back and returned with cheese, however the actually burger and chips were very cold at this point. No compensation was offered what-so-ever and very little apology was offered.

Pretty much all of them were patronizing.\n1/ the guy at the door was unimpressed and patronizing, also talked to me like I was insane showing up at such a late hour on a Saturday night (the doors open at 8pm but I wouldn't stay more than an hour anyway, gets a bit repetitive, so yeah, I must be totally out of my mind thinking I can just come in for an hour of rollerskating more than an hour prior to you closing)\n2/ the bouncer asked for my passport to check which country I was from, which I showed to him on the cover, to which he said...\"that not really telling me anything\", and proceeded to analyse all my visas. Now I'm sure my being in Cambodia this year is totally relevant my amazingness on skates - so fair enough, it's so much fun to play immigration at a bar.\n2/ the manager, who I talked to to try and get us in had such a busy night (HAHAHA) that he waved at the guy to let us in, which they all questioned once he was gone - it took us 10 min waiting to get in from that point - there was 7 staff looking at us and no clients.\n3/ I had to talk to 5 people to let us in and got a lot of shit from the girl at the coat check because she had to go find coins to reimburse me 1 pound (out of the 10 I had just given her for all of our coats, all at once... i don't know how to be helpful anymore)\n4/ the bar was closed\n5/ You've wronged the floor by kissing it... If you fall (which you can do, if you're not good at roller skating, the good news is someone will be here within 0.5 seconds... but will look at you like you just committed a criminal offense (to be clear - none of us were drunk - I just fell like 3 times because I'm not good on skates)\n6/ the hand-piece equipment was sweaty and stinky (like, seriously)\n7/ They treat you like children : you can't stop on the side for more that 1 second - that's fair enough, and makes sense... but you also get told off like a child for leaning your ass on the side of the table while watching other people skate \"because do you sit on the table at home\"? - I sh. you not. We're all over 30.\n\nSo all in all, if you wan't to skate, try your hardest to find somewhere else to go"

They have two different areas, one for the \"professional\" skaters and one that is more designed for beginners. Also, there is always a hand to help if you fall (which will happen most likely). However staff was not as helpful as I had expected with beginners, especially outside the rolling areas. The lounge area is also quite nice and a good place to enjoy a drink while you get the view from the rollerblading rink. "

An excellent venue, with two different areas playing a variety of music, helpful staff on hand to pick you up you fall over, and lots and lots of laughter. I can't recommend it enough. "

However....we duly waited at the bar to be served, and waited some more, out of the three bar staff behind the bar two were chatting with themselves admiring their mid drifts and the other one was nattering with two pals at the end of the bar. After five minutes of standing right in front of the two who were admiring themselves, myself and three friends left the premises and had a wonderful evening in the Lord John Russell around the corner, who served drinks promptly, efficiently and with a smile.\n\nMay I suggest that this bar trains the bar staff to actually serve drinks or remove the cloak of invisibility device that has been installed and stops them carrying out their job role."

We had pre-booked a table inside and was told that once we payed in that we would have free drinks on our table. Once inside I had realised that for no reason what so ever they had not let half my group of friends in and that we didn't actually have a table! It was empty inside and had a bad, unwelcoming atmosphere. When going back upstairs to enquire about our table the lady behind the paying desk was stabbing me with her finger aggressivly to move back down the stairs, and called for a bouncer to throw me out when I tried to explain about our problem. We then left after being inside the club for about half an hour. Wish I had read other reviews before going as they seem to say the same thing.

When I told him this, he took me outside and said 'i will help you look for it, even though you're being a bitch'. My boyfriend and random people who had witnessed the conversation were disgusted by him, and he soon ran away when these people confronted him. His own staff couldn't have been more apologetic and embarrassed.\n\n He was unapologetic- until he discovered my boyfriend's occupation could cause trouble for him- at this point he apologised and booked and paid for our taxi. I would never go back here- that guy is clearly not coping, and it put a really bitter end to the night.

We then came upstairs for a few drinks, and had a good time. The DJ provided party and pop tunes from across the last 3 decades or so - some classic tunes in there and he generally pitched it just right.\n\nWhilst it was midweek and therefore relatively quiet, (I imagine it would be heavin gon a friday/saturday night), the place still had a good atmosphere. My one detraction was the bar staff were incredibly slow and inefficient. Even when staff were not serving others they took an age to get to you, preferring instead to finish wiping a table or rearranging some bottles. When you did get served there was a distinct disinterest in you, at one point the barman just disappeared out back without a word immediately after I ordered. I ended up ordering again from one of the other staff, and just after they had sorted most of the drinks the first barman reappeared clutching a wine glass wihtout any word of explanation. (How they manage to run out of glasses when it was that quiet I don't know!)\n\nAnyway, drinks and music was OK but service was shocking. Prices were expensive, but no more so then you'd expect for a late license venue in this part of london. I won't be returning for a random drink at any point, but should there be an event here (e.g. birthday) then I wouldn't mind!"

One of the best features of LV is that you can go online and compile your own playlist so that you don't have to waste time going through the song catalogue after arriving at the lounge. They also stock goofy props in each room (wigs, hats, inflatable instruments) so you can really get into the spirit of karaoke. That being said, I do find Lucky Voice on the expensive side if you don't manage to book in advance. "

          "text": "When a restaurant is rated second on a top 5 list, you expect it to be good. So I went to 34 in Mayfair with high hopes, after reading The Cow Council Top 5 at http://www.thecowclubcouncil.com/#!the-top-5/c3nb. The review on their website http://www.thecowclubcouncil.com/#!34/c1rff read promising, and I thought when even Jay Rayner liked it (http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/01/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-34), what could go wrong? \n\nTo cut it short, nothing did go wrong. But let's go through this pleasant evening in more detail. 34 is located in Mayfair, so you have to expect Mayfair prices - an evening at 34 is not a big night out on a tiny budget. I think the restaurant has a very classy atmosphere, there are some nice and some interesting paintings on the walls and a live piano player entertains the diners with some fine tunes. Thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThanks to a recent wine tasting with Convivium Wine (http://conviviumwine.com/) hosted by Google+ Local London (https://plus.google.com/+GoogleLocalLondon), I discovered a new white wine that I really liked. And when I spotted an Albariño on the fine wine menu, I knew that I had to taste this one. If you don't know about Albariño, you can read about it on the WineTubeMap at http://conviviumwine.com/wine-tube-map/station/albarino - a very nice tool to explore new wines. So I asked for the Albariño and it tasted delicious. A fresh and crisp wine, just perfect. But I have to say, it was not the cheapest wine on the menu - yet again, this is Mayfair.\n\nNow to the food, I was very happy to get a sample of about four different kinds of bread to begin with, and all tasted good. I decided to get a proper starter and ordered the fried duck egg with chorizo and watercress. What a delightful plate of food! The main was equally great, a tender and soft steak that melted in my mouth and really was worth it. \n\nBesides the food, the service also was a treat. The staff were very friendly and nice and simply provided a decent service. When I came in, some were joking behind the counter, and while a few people might find that unacceptable at such a serious restaurant, I found it welcoming to see that they are just people like me who want to enjoy themselves on the job. Maybe I had the best waiter in the world, I really liked him. Perhaps because he said that I selected his favourites, and he might say that to every single guest to make them feel good, after all that's what he's being paid for, but for some reason I believed him. \n\nWhen I walked out, I noticed the open kitchen - another nice feature of this place. \n\nWhile everything at 34 is on the expensive side, I personally think that food, wine and service is almost as good is it could get, and for such an extraordinary dining experience, I am happy to pay a bit more. You can feel pretty poor when leaving the venue without asking for a cab or jumping right into your Rolls-Royce or Mercedes SLS just in front of the restaurant or one of the Porsches or Landrovers parked all over the streets around 34. But then, I'd rather drink another glass of wine and take the bus, than getting a cab home for the same price.\n\nIf you like a good steak or good food in general and value impeccable service, I cannot recommend 34 highly enough.

But on the inside it is fabulous - especially the welcoming open gas fire in the casual lounge/bar area.\nWhat wonderful service we had from all of the staff. Do yourself a favour and go for the full breakfast deal...well worth it. We dined a few times and couldn't fault the food. Probably a little pricey, but very pleasant. The rooms were nice enough. Adjustable bed firming dial on side of bed - unusual but find it when you first book in.\nWould definitely recommend this hotel.\n\n"

The tiles rocked under my feet, the grout was missing from multiple shower tiles and the mold had a formidable hold on the shower. It had a distinctly musty smell to it. I will choose the Hampton inn next time."

It is well located just 15 mins drive from Luton Airport and on the leafy and quiet Hertfordshire part of Luton. \nThe food here is excellent and the Hilton standards are amazingly upheld here.\nI thoroughly enjoyed my weekend and the Manager is a credit to the Organisation. \n"

Rooms were spotless, the only downfall was the time that it took for the food to arrive as we were eating at the restaurant, but I think that it was a one time thing. I'll surely visit again."
