It's worth visiting this place for the view alone, but as a venue it's great in that it holds a really good number of people, the right size for it to feel fairly intimate but still big enough to attract big acts. Plus there's always two big screens set up so if you are struggling to see the main stage, you'll still not miss any of the excitement.\nThe one drawback is the prices of beer and food when you're there, but the venue is not to blame for this, and it's always to be expected anyway!\nA great venue for some great acts. Highly recommended."

I always would ask my mum to take a detour via Alexander Palace to see the magnificent views over London. This North London hotspot is a nice getaway from busy London with large grounds, a small boating lake, deer and a nice place to eat and drink. Instead of paying the high prices to see the city from places like the Shard or the London Eye why not try a free trip to Ally Pally as it has been affectionately nicknamed. "

Get there super early if going for a gig though because its huge and if you're at the back you will see nothing because they dont have any screens! If you want the front then you should honestly be there about 10 hours early! No exaggeration"

One of the best places to watch the fireworks on bonfire night, the view will make it worth the trip, especially at nighttime. Alexandra Palace in itself also hosts loads of interesting exhibits which give plenty of excuses to go and peek at the London skyline over and over again. "

The front desk, however, was extremely accommodating and provided me with a room! \n\nOnly thing I had an issue with was the bathroom tub door - the seal at the bottom was not tight, and so when showering, water would leak out and drip onto the floor. The first time this happened my floor was partially flooded - I ended up putting towels there as a preemptive measure."

My life is more about having an atmosphere to work and create then be the life of the party. I love a hotel that can pamper by just having the little things that I need at my figure tips. The staff was incredible from check in to check out. The staff was pleasurable and charming, so on my next visit to London you will know where to find me at The Cavendish Hotel."

The views across London were stunning - we could see The London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster and the Shard easily from our window.The comfort of the bed was simply divine - the best I have ever had in a London hotel. The Nespresso coffee machine was a welcome surprise and the pods were even replenished while we were out at the theatre - hows that for service! All the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming - nothing was too much trouble. The hotel had booked us tickets for Singin in The Rain which was an absolute delight and the seats were excellent. Breakfast was fabulous - I particularly liked how each item was locally sourced and labelled where it was from. The hotels own home made marmalade is a gastronomic treat for the taste-buds( how I wish I had taken a little pot home !) The Cavendish is in an ideal central location where many of London's attractions are only a short walk away. I would recommend The Cavendish to anyone wanting great service and a little luxury - I absolutely loved it and hope to stay again."

After roughly an hour or so actually in the venue dancing and having only ONE drink (worth mentioning this was all of our 3rd drink of the entire night) we decided it was cigarette time, so we proceeded to the outside smoking area.\n \nAfter our smoke we re-approached the entrance only to be told that we were not allowed back in because we had \"had too much to drink\". This was of course absurd and very confusing as we had literally had one drink in your venue and 2 prior to this, so we were not even on the cusp of tipsy. The doorman who initially refused our entry first picked out one of the three of us as being \"too intoxicated\" and after our friend proved he was not, the doorman then decided to pick on me because I had a limp. \n \nThis instantly proved that the doorman and the rest of your \"security team\" were simply trying to minimise numbers in the venue by any means, and after being told that my limp was due to a Car Accident, the doorman then said, and I quote \"walk for me\", I found this extremely unfair, belittling and a complete abuse of my human rights.\n \nAnother doorman on the door told this other guy that we were all fine as he has initially let us in when we arrived, and he felt there was no reason to refuse us entry, so after our jackets were disgusting chucked at us, we were allowed back in. We spent a maximum of about 15 more minutes in the venue before deciding ourselves to leave, due to the fact our evening in Heaven had been too tarnished with abuse, prejudice behaviour and a complete disregard for our human rights.\n \nWe then went onto have some food and proceed home.\n \nThis email is prelude to a much larger bombardment on the venue and staff as I will be taking this further and posting it on every social media platform I know, and will also be asking if any of the local Brighton, London and south eastern papers would like to be involved in exposing the sort of behaviour your venue has promoted.\n \nAlso, as an ex venue promoter for Brighton and Hove, I know exactly how the club circuit works, especially gay venues and this was an awful representation of what should be a warm, welcoming and comfortable industry to be a part of, be it as a customer or employee.\n \nI am not a greedy, selfish, or abrupt person. However after this atrocious behaviour, I do believe we deserve some form of apology, I especially after being told my temporary disability was fake and being made to walk purely for the amusement of a corrupt and unprofessional \"doorman\".\n \nAlso none of this is even remotely exaggerated and the CCTV will contest to that, in fact the above if anything is underplayed."

Despite me phoning up the day before to explicitly ask Heaven if getting a guest list would mean that we'd be able to get in hassle-free on Friday night at 12:30, the bouncer at the door told me this was \"complete rubbish\", begging the question what on earth is the point of a guest list if people can't get in? One of my party was arbitrarily barred from going in for asking about the guest list system. Two stars and unlikely to receive another visit from me or any of my friends, especially when hired bouncers, ESPECIALLY the female bouncer on Friday nights, are extremely rude and unhelpful to paying customers."

The sandwiches and rolls were stale, the pastries disappointing, but the scones with cream were delicious. My tea (liquorice and ?) had a sickly taste and I was unable to finish it. My wife's Earl Grey was watery, despite allowing infusion time. For £20 a head, I would have expected much better. Have no intention of returning.

The events manager absolutely refused to let me do this until about two minutes before the beginning of the meal. I don't know why, as I would have been completely out of the way of all catering staff preparing the room. The manager didn't seem to have any reason that she could explain and was extremely hostile and unhelpful.\n\nAs a result I had a ridiculously short time to take photos of the bride and groom, and it nearly wrecked their wedding photos. I photograph a lot of weddings and I know how to keep out of the way and not cause problems, in return I hope for a bit of cooperation from venues and their staff. In this case I didn't get any.\n\nAfter the wedding I wrote a complaint to the manager of the Swan but got no reply. I wrote again and still no reply. Even if they disagreed with everything I'd said, I would have expected them to write and tell me why, but nothing. I'd advise you to spend your money somewhere else, especially if you are getting married!"

They have 3 bars so you don't have to wait too long for drinks and no matter how far away you are from the stage, you are almost guaranteed a good view! (I think the angle of the floor is subtle and the stage is just high enough to make a difference!) They have an upstairs mezzanine area also so if you don't want to be in the thick of it or want to chill in a booth, the option is there. Of course, the sound depends on a variety of factors but when these lined up, the riffs were crisp and the vocals audible enough to sing along with! The staff that work there are helpful and lovely also. Good place for a big rock gig! "

A lot of the action took place on those six lit up chairs that you can see with the actors not taking part in that particular scene facing away from the audience or dimmed by light. The stage is also surrounded by a moat of water which plays an interesting part towards the end as well. It gets more chaotic as the play progresses which is of course symbolism of Paul’s own mindset."

The bar is spacious and is used well with singers, performers and special events where you can meet playwrights and directors. The bookshop is a small but impressive selection of new and classics texts, and watch out for their special sales to pick up some real bargains. The Royal Court also has possibly the comfiest theatre seats in their main stage space. That may seem like a relatively unimportant aspect of your theatre experience but having paid a decent amount of money at bigger theatres to then be distracted through the performance by having a numb bum...not ideal! They're lovely bucket style, and work in the lovely auditorium space. Looking forward to see what Vicky Featherstone does here. "

I wasn't into the idea of navigating London by car the first time I landed there (or ever, frankly), so Marylebone station being right outside the \"back door\" couldn't have been more convenient. \n\nDid you know that Marylebone is where the opening scene of A Hard Day's Night was filmed? You probably did, since you're an Internet nerd reading hotel reviews on Google. I imagine a lot of things happened on that street that are less famous and just as interesting. \n\nThe Landmark was The Hotel Grand Central when it was built in the 1890s by some railroad tycoon. Those were the days, weren't they, when we had railroad tycoons and steel magnates and robber barons under every rock, amassing ridiculous personal wealth on top of mountains of dead serfs. Ah, nostalgia!\n\nAs for hotel specifics, I hardly remember anything, other than very grand staircases and the strange sensation that I was missing something every time I came back to the room in the evening after housekeeping had been to visit. Reminded me of staying in the Hotel St. Paul in the 70s when it was little more than a flophouse and having the maid, such as she was, pilfer my bottle of whiskey from the dresser drawer. I was just a teenager, so when I went to the front desk to complain, the guy squinted at me for a few seconds, told me to \"fuck off,\" and went back to watching a football game on a tiny black and white TV. But I showed him. I went back up to my room, removed the screens from all of the windows and tossed them down into the overgrown \"courtyard\" below. Like I said, I was a teenager. But it was much more enjoyable in the room with proper ventilation, that's a fact. The mosquitoes were worse, but you'd expect that.\n\nAh, London, right. Nice hotel. Though I spent most of my time at Pinewood Studios or wandering the city trying to get lost. An activity I heartily recommend any time you find yourself in a new place. Just go out and start walking, or get on a train going in some random direction. That's the best way to see what's really going on wherever you are. Most of the time you can eventually make it back to your bed. When you can't, well, that's where you get stories to tell, isn't it."

It lays claim to being the site of the oldest riverside tavern, dating from around 1520. It was formerly known as the Devil’s Tavern, on account of its dubious reputation. Before that it was officially called The Pelican. All that remains from the building’s earliest period is the 400 year old stone floor. In former times it was a meeting place for sailors, smugglers, cut-throats and footpads. Sir Hugh Willoughby sailed from here in 1533 in a disastrous attempt to discover the North-East Passage to China.\"\n\nBut i say... bloody good pub!"

And when wanted to do £16 per person buffet of food, got attitude like i'm being difficult. Originally was doing the £12.95 buffet, so was providing another £3 per person. Odd. This reply consisted of a suggestion to find another venue and will get my full deposit back. If wasn't 4 days prior I would. A quote I like \"I’ve never had some much trouble trying to organize such a small party!\" I have 30 ppl. Talk about stuck up. Id expect the same effort if it was 5 people or 50. In the end they cancelled my booking 2 days prior as I complained about the customer service but really they wanted the room for a larger group I found out.\n\nWill pop in for my drinks now and then as I do but won't again organize a event with them.

The Steam room was broken when we went, the pool was one of those treatment ones for sports people where you turn it on and go against the current, not exactly relaxing and not exactly big. We didn't stay in this part for more than 20 minutes.\n\nWe then sat in a quiet room, to have a bit of food and drink before we left which was quite relaxing.\n\nWhen we went to leave, there was information about a free shuttle offered, so I asked for that to museum row, the person turned up to take us in their car, chatting to the receptionist about calling him on his personal mobile. There was no taxi information, there was no meter, once we arrived at our destination, he decided it was £25 ... for a 10 minute journey. I asked for a receipt but was told I couldn't have one. I contacted the hotel afterwards to ask for a refund, receipt or explanation, they said that the \"taxi\" was a third party firm they used. I asked for more information on which one, they said \"it could be 1 of 3\", so not sure, sorry\"\n\nThis made me think, they aren't really that trustworthy and aren't of the \"make the customer happy\" mantra, so I am avoiding this place.

Our starters (eg, the crab) were distinctly average - certainly not worth the £20 - and the main courses pretty much the same. We had fish dishes that would have been respectable in an average British pub but would have cost a third of what we paid. Likewise, the desserts were unimpressive. On the plus side, the sommelier's choice of wine was good. Service was pleasant but unexceptional.\n\nThe restaurant has a lovely setting, a nice buzz and is good for people watching but definitely a much over-priced and over-rated restaurant. Definitely won't be back."

Clearly this will not end well for your reputation and more to the point if you have a rogue member of staff stealing petty items from the general public you can be assured that they will also be stealing other items from your company (I wont be the first nor the last).\n\nI do not have time to report to the police such an incident nor do I have the desire to get involved with an ongoing investigation on your behalf. I have explained that I am leaving the country on the 15th and will be in Argentina for the next 5 months. Further to suggest I should wait for the insurance to pay you out before I get any form of recompense is also despicable. \n\nI have reported this incident without making any claims for compensation, thats not to say I would not have accepted such in good faith, but when such incidents occur, it is our responsibility to report these to the management else nothing will be done and that person will continue doing to others and yourselves. When you find that an opportunist crime has taken place involving your own money and own staff you will NOT be able to say \"I had no idea our staff were committing such crimes\", we have informed you and I hope that happens sooner rather than later given your apathy in our case.\n\nKind regards"

You might have to cross the road a baffling number of times to get to them though. "

A porter came to our room and kindly took our cases and bags to the storage room for the day so we could have a few hours in London before our train home. He took the trolley straight into the storage room and came out with a ticket for 6 items. We returned a few hours later to catch a taxi to the station and they kindly offered to load our bags into the taxi after we had collected them. It was not until we got to the train station did we realise that a rucksack with my daughters ipad in was not with us. With only a few minutes until our train my husband had to dash back, only to be told that we gave in six bags and six were collected. We very naively trusted the porter to take those bags straight into the storage room while we waited in a queue for our ticket and did not count the exact number of bags(a lesson!!) Eventually my husband got the rucksack back but we missed our train and incurred extra charges. I explained this to the head of luggage and he said, \"sorry!\""

We were tired so took an easy option of ordering a set menu of two courses and a bottle of wine, after much deliberation. When the wine arrived, I had to unfortunately discuss with the our garzón as it was slightly corked, which they promptly accepted and opened another bottle to taste, which was indeed better. \n\nThrough out the whole evening we received excellent service and recommendation to enhance our experience of being there. The Large open bar in the middle and view of thames at night all add up to the ambience. You feel like you are among the élite as the hustle and bustle in the busy side of the restaurant all add up, yet you can comfortably have a decent and private conversation in these comfy chairs. Perhaps its the high ceilings that prevents the other sounds over powering your own voice. \n\nIts a great place to have a glass of wine, while watching London go buy on the river. If you can get here before sunset, its a definite worthwhile transition to the evening there are seats around the bar area if you don't want to be sitting down for dinner. \n\nBut be warned, its a heavy foot traffic area, so either book in advance or go there early, you will find affluent tourists, performers, organisers of South Bank Events, to City Londoners socialising here, though, its hardly ever empty, but when you look outside those windows, it will be just you and the rest of the world,.. and of course that drink on your hand."

The waiters and service were very good unfortunately the food is tastetless and over priced. I ordered from the theatre menu and had pumkin soup for starters which was fairly ok rather standard not even a little garnish. For main my friend had duck from the al carte menu and I had pork with a dollop of sloppy mash, both were nothing special I have had much better in cheaper restaurants. I was so put off I decided against having a third course. We had intended to dine out splash some cash but did not get good value for money. The champage was good as was the wine even though we were given a dearer wine then the one we had asked for, we didn't complain because we wanted to have a nice evening. As a whole this was a poor dining experience and I'm afraid the view did not compensate. I felt bad that I did not pay the full service charge because it wasn't the waiters fault only the kitchen's, however I made that call because It's not possible to deduct from the bill. The kitchen is seriously lacking and is letting the side down!"

          "text": "I am a Nobu fan. I have eaten at Nobu from Moscow to Malibu. But Berkeley Street was a shocking disappointment.\n\nAs I was solo this visit, the hostess beckoned me to my seat at the edge of the sushi bar. I was not keen for the seat as I was flanked on my left by a woman, half of whose body jetted into my space as she flirted desperately with her date. To my right was a series of bottles protruding from the wall, the effect of which was a medieval iron maiden, where the necks seemed like spikes into my right arm. Pay no heed I told myself; the fish would be good, and I would soon lay my sake-infused jet-lagged cranium on my soft hotel pillow.\n\nWithout a thought I asked my waiter for a sashimi plate and an order of oshinko. But I requested that the chef hold off on the tuna and the salmon. The waiter proclaimed that they would instead charge me a la carte as apparently 6 of the 14 pieces needed be tuna and salmon for the 39 quid sashimi plate. I protested, stating that menu carried a disclaimer that tuna could be substituted. He retorted that the waiver related only to bluefin tuna for environmental reasons. I said, 'whatever', but if he brought me either I wouldn't eat it.\n\nWithin 5 minutes a chef - who had twice wiped his brow with his hand and rubbed his face with his sleeve all the while handling my raw foods - set a plate in front of my hungry eyes: hamachi, mackerel, snapper, a scallop, two pieces of scampi and of course tuna. I told the chef I didn't want tuna; he said, 'You said no bluefin tuna.'. He didn't wipe his brow at least.\n\nHungry and impatient already, I ate. The hamachi was icy, and the scallops were rubbery. True, normally they are rubbery, but these were downright gumby-ish. All of the pieces were cold, like refrigerator cold. Roughly five minutes later, the rice came. Rather than a mellow blend, hot and moist, the rice tasted as if it had been microwaved. Dry and kernel-like, it would barely be eaten.\n\nAll that remained of my plate were the three pieces of tuna. The waiter then came to refill my water and asked how things were. I stated the truth in four-letter words, adding that the tuna looked as if it had been taken out of a can. A dull shade of red, lacking that deep semi-iridescent look, the tuna did seem as if it came anywhere but from the fish monger.\n\nRoughly 8-10 min later, the oshinko came, but by this point, I was hardly in the mood to savor one of my favorite treats. I chugged the remaining bit of sake (which was excellent btw), slurped my remaining pickles and asked for the check.\n\nUpon departure, I did ask the hostess how to make a complaint. Unwilling to assist me - or understand me, she passed me on to another waiter, who apologized for the fact that the manager was entertaining a client. He tried to take notes, but I knew he was powerless. So I take to Google to warn people of the sashimi plate, an unimaginative blend of meager fish, a collection one piece of octopus short of the set meal at the food court in Minneapolis rather than a Nobu on one of the more exclusive streets in London.\n\nGo for the hot food. Go for the sake. Expect to be belittled. Don't go alone. And avoid anything, upon which the chef may either inflict his unclean hands or utter lack of originality."

We scheduled a last minute meeting for tea here, although we did try to book first. My friend was told that it was fully reserved but we can try to walk in.\n\nLo and behold, counting our lucky stars, when we walked in at 430pm on a Saturday they found a spare table which they need back at 6pm for dinner, and we thought why not, 1.5 hours are quite sufficient for tea, so we were seated.\n\nThe decor of the place is pretty grand but you are not charged extortionate prices for the pleasure, which was of course, very pleasurable ;) I opted for a cream tea which consisted of 3 scones with the normal clotted cream and strawberry jam and went for Darjeeling tea, and my friend asked for Earl Gray with a slice of cheese cake.\n\nThe food was good but nothing spectacular. While I thought the cheese cake tasted pretty average, maybe excelling at being more smooth in texture than usual, I wouldn't really say this is a thing to die for. The scones were also pretty much what one would expect, although I really appreciate the place giving me plenty of clotted cream and jam to slather generously over my scones. Nothing like not enough toppings to go around to spoil your mood right?\n\nI have had a look at the afternoon tea which includes the sandwiches and also other desserts, but it didn't really strike me as that much more fanciful than other high tea places. Now if they were doing super cute themes like in the Landau (i.e. Valentines theme, Fashion week themed cakes/desserts), I would be more tempted to give this more stars. Service is good, the decor is good, the food is so so, therefore this place gets a 4 stars from me!"

The waiter who had taken our cups, when she brought them back she missed one of us out! And, the restaurant was not fully booked- god only knows how you cope then!\n\nAlso, can someone explain why in this day and age silver tea pots with handles that are far too hot to hold are served I really don't know. The least the waiter could have done was make us aware of the hot handles instead my daughter screeched when she touched it!!\n\nWe went to the Wolseley as it was recommended in one of the Sunday magazines and my daughter treated me, as it was a pre birthday outing, and the rest of the family. \n\nIt would be good to hear from someone from the Wolseley as I feel if Gordon Ramsey visited the place he would shut it down - inefficient, staff in need of basic training and incompetent.

I understand that it is based in central London so prices are going to be high, but £14 for a Double Vodka and lemonade seems a little pricey when its only £7 for a single!\nAlso at first we was discussing whether to have the table but we decided for how much it worked out for us to pay we would rather stay on the dance floor, which then we was made to re-pay our entry fee even though we had already paid once, so it cost the girls £20 to get in the end each and the boys £40! \nAmazing place and had a really good night but found the money situation a little ridiculous in the end!

Despite paying an over priced entrance, and an additional £900 for a friends birthday to be celebrated- we were given a lot of attitude by staff, especially bouncers. They refused our entry and when asked why, they angrily replied 'we legally don't have to give you a reason to allow you back in'. I would understand if I had been drunk, or even slightly wobbly- but I was neither. There was no justification for the way their bouncers had treated my friends and I. The birthday girl was told to 'wait outside for 15 minutes to cool down'. She also had not been tipsy and was not given any reasoning as to why she was told to wait outside. Strongly recommend you do not waste your time or money here. "

Arriving half an hour early we were greeted with smiles and were seated at our table right away, even though I was expecting to wait at the bar. Every member of staff were attentive, jolly and made you feel at home right from the moment we walked through the door. \n\nThe food was just as mesmerising as the decor. The Lobster Pelmeni were elegantly served and melted in the mouth. The sweetness of the lobster and salmon roe delicately complimented one another with bursts of flavour and texture. My partners Zakuski taster plate was just as delicate. Not being a fan of Russian Olivier salad, I was happy to let him enjoy his favourite dish. Which I have been informed was better than his mothers. Best we keep that under our hats. \n\nFor the main I ordered the Fillet Mignon Rosini and yet again I was not disappointed. The aged beef fillet packed in loads of flavour, which held a certain sweetness against the seared melt in the mouth foie gras and refreshing morsels of apple. Although the fillet was exceptional, the crispy pork belly won hands down. The Suckling Pork Belly was a superb balance of flavours which left your mouth watering and demanding you order another plate to wash down the first helping.\n\nOur deserts were just as glamorous as well s comforting. The trio of crème brulees were small but deadly, the sweetness of each were a divine, light and refreshing way to end the meal. My dish however, was certainly heavy and rich. The Bob Bob Ricard Signature Chocolate Glory was in anything theatrical and spectacular. Being the woman that I am, who loves all things chocolate was mesmerised by the beauty of the dish but found it hard to it and felt it needed just a little something extra to cut through the richness of the chocolate mouse an was thankful for the little cube of treasure that was the passion fruit and orange jelly.\n\nOverall I was extremely happy to have experienced the eccentricity and humble food (with a twist) of Bob Bob Ricard. I can not wait to return and try more of thee menu, although it certainly would be nice to see a few more Russian dishes make an appearance on the menu in the future though. \n\nAs I said before, the staff were amazing making sure our glasses were constantly topped up, that our every whim and need was not only catered for but genuinely cared about. Not once did they rush us to eat in order to seat the next guests but gave us time to enjoy our food and each others company in a warm atmospheric environment. \n\nI have to say the measly 12.5% service charge added to the bill certainly wasn't enough to show our appreciation of our time here and should be doubled for the amount of effort and grace displayed by each member of staff. \n\n"

Nothing that the restaurant itself is at fault for but to be aware of when you decide to dine in such a prime location. \n\nThe wine menu at first glance looks extensive but when after asking I was informed that the small x's next to over half the list meant they were out of stock, it soon dwindled. \n\nThe food is nice. It's decent (duck patè to start, steak for main with a side of chips and sticky toffee pudding for desert). It's nice because it's nice. It's decent because of the City prices you are paying for the food. \n\nWhat saved this place for me is the attentive staff who were friendly but not too over beating and the views however I won't be rushing back anytime soon.

For main courses the battered fish and chips was good but the roast beef with Yorkshires and roast potatoes a big disappointment. No wine or coffee, just a few beers and water brought the bill close to £100 which seemed expensive – but I suppose that’s what you have to pay for the view – where else can you see Tower Bridge, the Gherkin, the Cheesegrater and the Walkie Talkie in one glance? Our waitress (only her third day at this restaurant) was friendly and efficient but the service could have been speedier – although we were seated just after a large party (10/12?) which slowed things down somewhat."

It is highly recommended to enter before 9pm due to the entrance is free. In addition, this will make you avoid the big queues outside. The club is divided in 6 different spaces: The Tiger bar, The Tiger Grill, The Cloud Lounge, The Groovy Wonderland, The White room and The Opal bar. You will find a different music style in any of these rooms, so there is a huge music choice for everybody. It is a good option to pre-book a table if you are a big group due to you will have some extra benefits in alcohol and food packages. Drinks are bit expensive so it is recommendable to go there for the happy hour (normally from 5pm to 8pm). Apart from that it is a classic club on the Londoners’ night which is worthy to visit. "

It’s got a good sized outdoor area for eating and smoking (not really my flavour).

Having queued outside for over half an hour, with other people in the queue being approached for being too drunk and sent away we were allowed up to the door and then immediately turned away by 'Damian' who could give us no justified reason, was smug, smirking and rude towards us (a group of young female professionals). 'Damian' refused to give us his name and was purposefully blocking his ID card from view so we couldn't obtain his details. After having asked for the manager we were then made to wait for another half an hour outside in the cold before she was able to see us. 'Beth' (manager) agreed that we were not too drunk to enter but despite this still wouldn't allow us inside (again with no due reason), it was also only due to her arrival that 'Damian' would give his name.\n\nToday we phoned the venue and spoke to the general manager 'Simon' who was quiet possibly the worst manager I have ever dealt with. He repeated told us it was probably our fault for either (listing repeatedly) 1. No ID, 2. Being too drunk, 3. Having been barred and refused to even consider our side of the case. He repeatedly said \"well what do you want me to do about it?\", he refused to make any form of contact with the door staff or manager from the evening,he kept interrupting and attempting to blame us for last nights discourses and made numerous assumptions as to our behavior, insinuating that were were drunk and aggressive, despite him not even being present the night before.\n\nWhen trying to end the phone call, I asked him to talk to the manager and door staff from the previous night and to then email me with his/their response, his response was an indignant \"I am NOT taking your email.\" After having expressed our concern over the multitude of bad reviews of the club (based almost solely on the rude staff) and with this unacceptably response, I informed the manager that he could expect four more negative reviews and four less customers and ended the phone call.\n\nAvoid The Roxy and its staff unless you want to be abused and victimized.

We opted for the two course a la carte meal and the meal was complete with tiny complimentary dessert treats served on a platter. The dishes may not have been particularly innovative but the quality of food was impeccable."

Trust me when I say that hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about the wonderful dining experience we had at Pied a’ Terre last summer, and that every high-end restaurant we have patronized since has suffered in comparison. To explain: My husband, daughter and I from Los Angeles and my sister and her husband from Chevy Chase Maryland came together in England last June to attend Ladies’ Day at Royal Ascot. While the races were the primary reason for the trip (and did indeed totally live up to expectations), I was tasked with finding marvelous things to do during the week leading up to the main event. At this point I don’t recall how I came across Pied a’ Terre but WOW! We all agree that our lunch was one of the very best dining experiences we all have ever had – which as frequent world travelers and diners is actually saying something. The food was exquisite, but what really set the experience apart was the phenomenal service. I have written only two restaurant reviews in my life – and the one I wrote before this was for a highly touted “celebrity” spot in Los Angeles. While the food there was good, the service was beyond terrible and hence the experience was spoiled and certainly not worth the cost. Quite the opposite was true here. Although we were clearly “tourists” and hence unlikely to return any time soon, the restaurant staff treated us like royalty. The amount of pleasure this added to the meal and the experience is incalculable. As said, this was one of the very best dining experiences ever, and we will be forever grateful. Bravo!"

          "text": "AWFUL PLACE EVEN IF YOU'VE BOOKED WITH THEM!!\n\nI had been liaising via email and telephone calls with two members of the Mahiki team since 16th October in regards to my birthday booking. I made a reservation for a table of 10 at 23.00 on Saturday 8th of November. \n\nMy group arrived at 22.45. At the door we were told that my table booking was made for 21.00 and I was two hours late thus my table had been given away. I produced my string of emails and booking form that clearly stated 23.00 to the man at the door, but was told (rudely) that nothing could be done. I then asked if any larger, thus more expensive tables were available as it was really important to me that I got in and celebrated my birthday. I was told no, and I was also told my group was too big to be accommodated (there were only eight of us) - we were not allowed to enter the club. I asked to speak to those I had been liaising with but was told they only work during the day.\n\nI would like to point out at this point that my group were all EXTREMELY well presented. The six females were in dresses and heels, and the two males wore shirts, trousers and shoes. We were a mixed group all with ID. We followed every recommendation you had made. I also had my large birthday cake with me as I had also previously discussed with you, a cake that had cost me £90.00 and had been made for the occasion with a Mahiki style theme. \n\nThe man at the door was quite rude and did not sympathise with my situation. We were refused entry despite offering to pay double the original minimum spend for a table. Now here is where one of the biggest issues lies. We were asked to not stand outside the club and thus stood across the road as we discussed what to do and were approached by a local promoter. Behind us in the queue were a group of six females, one of whom I knew and had had a brief discussion with in the queue. I therefore know that her group did not have a table reserved and were already highly intoxicated. As I stood on the other side of the road I was absolutely furious to see that these girls were granted admission to the club. \n\nLet me tell you something about my group of eight. I myself am a white British female. There was a white male, a black male, a black female, an Asian female and three mixed race females. I believe my group were turned away on racial grounds. How can your organisation clearly have made a mistake and not offer any kind of agreement or compromise? Why were the group of six white, blonde females allowed in but we weren't? Why were we ushered to the other side of the road, as if to say we made the club look bad? \n\nI am absolutely outraged at the way I was treated and I honestly believe if my group had been all white, this would not have happened. It's disgusting that we were turned away after so many weeks of planning and liaising. Any mistakes made were on your (Mahiki's) part, and yet it not only cost me financially, but it ruined my birthday night, that I will never get back. \n\nIt' also funny how since the night i have emailed them and had no reply. Disgusting"

For those out to really celebrate, get a group and purchase the Treasure Chest!\n\nThe female servers were dressed in Hawaiian outfits & the male servers as pirates. One the servers even spoke in a 'pirate' accent.\n\nOverall - a bit cheesy & tacky & wouldn't make it a regular haunt, but a fun place overall to dance & bring friends from out of town! "

Su ubicación es extraordinaria, a escasos metros de Oxford St., bien rodeada de locales para desayunar (alternativa recomendable al desayuno del propio hotel) y con buena cantidad de paradas de autobús para moverse por la ciudad con facilidad.\n\nLástima que con todas estas bazas para convertirse en una de las opciones más recomendables para alojarse en Londres, aparte de un precio bastante razonable, lo tiren por la ventana con un servicio poco atento y el escaso mantenimiento de sus instalaciones. \n\nEl hotel ha ido experimentando una cierta degradación en los últimos años y en mi última visita no llegaba el WiFi a la habitación, a escasos metros de la puerta del hotel dormía un homeless (sin que nadie pareciera hacer nada por evitarlo), el agua en el lavabo de la habitación no tenía fuerza suficiente y nadie cambió una bombilla fundida desde el primer hasta el último día.\n\nLo peor es que no me guardaron una tarjeta SIM de giffgaff, a pesar de haberlo advertido en llamada telefónica y me aseguraran que me la guardarían sin problemas. El recepcionista buscó con desgana y escasa amabilidad.\n\nEn la parte positiva, estuve en Navidades y nos invitaron a un vino en su salón de la última planta, desde donde hay unas interesantes vistas de la ciudad. Además, los baños públicos de esa planta son un auténtico lujo."

Started out with a selection of finger sandwiches. The tea selection is displayed in a wooden book with your choice of Herbal Tea or Infusion.\n This was my third time here and so I anticipated their speciality dessert/cake trolley as the final course, all made in-house, and there is a wide selection of home made pastries to choose from but their Cheesecakes are the best in fact the wait staff gave me a take home on my previous visit here.The scones were delectable , served covered over to keep them warm with preserves and clotted cream. After the afternoon tea they even offered us a coffee to enjoy in the lounge/lobby area but we just declined. Afternoon tea in Athenaeum is the perfect way to spend the afternoon chatting,relaxing and a good excuse to celebrate anything!"

My largest complaint was finding the location as it's hot indicated anywhere on the signage that it's a \"Doubletree\" property. So when I got into a cab and asked for the Doubletree near Canaby Street the driver looked at me like I had 3 heads.

It also claims that both Shakespeare and Dickens drank here. \n\nShakespeare died in 1616 so if he was here in 1677 the beer must have excellent restorative properties! Dickens actually gives it a brief mention in Little Dorrit and they have his life assurance policy on display in the Gallery Bar.\n\nBut it is the atmosphere that makes this a must visit place. Old corridors and stairways, low beamed ceilings all helping to create an ambience that is a genuine slice of London history.\n\nThe only downside is that all these features combine to make it extremely popular, so the place gets incredible busy and the wait to get served can be a long one."

At the same time I don't want you to be put off.\n\nI booked to go here with my girlfriend, after hearing about it from a well to do colleague and seeing that it has held a Michelin star for over a decade now.\n\nWe went and had their 'taste of hakassan menu', expecting it to blow us away, but unfortunately it just didn't.\n\nThe food is good, and undoubtedly better than any other Chinese restaurant I have been to previously, but in my opinion it isn't worth the money or Michelin star status and will leave quite a few customers disappointed if they're going for a special meal.\n\nOur bill (for 2) came to £140, without wine, which is very expensive for the quality and quantity of food that you get. I have had much better food at this price point.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant I felt was fantastic, very loud and almost nightclub like (quite a cool, sociable place to spend an evening) This might not suit everyone's tastes though but I personally thought it was great.\n\nIt's just the food didn't live up to what we hoped, it felt like a conveyor belt of the same dishes streaming out of the kitchen with no real passion or variance to what the chefs were doing.\n\nWe've only ever eaten at a 1 Michelin starred restaurant once before (in Austria), but there is absolutely no comparison. The one in Austria was easily 20x better without exaggeration. Perhaps we were just spoiled by our first Michelin star experience!\n\nIn summary, do give it a go, just don't put all your hopes on it for a big birthday / engagement / special occasion.\n"

It might have been nice for a staff member to request a little decorum.

Not being the \"foodie\" in the family, I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't really enjoy some of the more out-there courses, but I need not have worried. The food was an ever-changing delight, playing with texture, presentation, scent and even sound. As more of a meat lover than a fish fetishist, they were kind enough to substitute one salmon course on the menu for a melt-in-your-mouth pork belly dish - amazing!\n\nBut better even than the food (really?!) was the staff. They seemed instantly capable of adapting their service style to the guests' attitudes, being more formal with some guests and more relaxed with others. I was concerned that I might be under-dressed, but I felt completely at home at all times. The staff worked together as a well-oiled machine, despite the cramped service quarters (they really need the refit), always at hand when you needed them, but never hovering or intrusive.\n\nAll in all, it was incredibly satisfying to have a long-anticipated experience live up to the expectations we had developed. This was, hands down, the most I have ever spent on a meal, so if it hadn't lived up to the dream, I would have been really disappointed. Tasty and terrific - what a relief!\n\nThey will open The Fat Duck in Melbourne in early February 2015, while the Bray location is renovated, so if you find yourself on that side of the planet, be sure to stop in. And when they get back to their refurbished nest, give the duck a big welcome home!"

The food was incredible and the whole 4.5hr feast fantastically fun - what a relief that Heston never listened to anyone insisting you shouldn't play with your food! There's no denying that this isn't ever going to be described as a 'cheap' experience but, as a one-off treat and considering the incredible attention to detail (and months of preparatory work behind every dish), we felt it was definitely worth it for us.

We have watched Heston on TV, heard so much from friends and family and was super keen to go to The Fat Duck - dating back to more than three years! We finally made it after a friend posted on Facebook that The Fat Duck will be relocating to Melbourne (Aus) for six months. We didn't want to miss out in case they decide to take The Fat Duck all around the world and not come back anytime soon... So we somehow got a very last minute mid week reservation! The Universe always helps you when you know what you want eh? As a vegetarian going with a full omnivore, we got the vegetarian menu and the original menu. Word of caution to other vegetarians, they do warn you that gelatine is used in some of the dessert courses at the beginning. Personally I was relatively OK with that because well - I know I sound like a hypocrite, but I really didn't want to miss out on any course that I am already going to pay for (literally and figuratively)! So if you are strict, be very clear when making your reservation!\n\nAnyway - as a vegetarian, I don't feel at all like I missed out (i felt really ripped off at Noma's residency at Claridges - but not on every dish). There were 14 courses and many came with a suggested wine. As I am doing DryApril and I don't drink wine, we started with a glass of rose champagne - but I really shouldn't have on an empty stomach, went straight to my head. Although the restaurant was at full capacity, you can't really hear the conversation next to you if you are not trying to hear them. I don't want to spoil the experience for ppl who haven't been, so I will just say, it's at times theatrical, but mainly, it's a gastronomic experience best reserved for a special occasion or for the hard core foodie - as it ain't cheap! Desserts are outstanding.\n\nNote - they will be closed for 6 months (while in Melb) to completely refurb the kitchen (extension). The dining area will also be reduced. So if you want to try the original menu, what the bloody hell are you waiting for? Otherwise, wait - and the new kitchen should enable them to extend their repertoire. "

No more need to feel bound to Belgos just to get a drink!\n\nTHE PROS\n- Strawberry Fruli on tap, other Fruli flavours on bottles\n- Mussels, mussels and more mussels. Seafood offers. Loyalty cards. Beat the clock offers (pay the time you order the food before 630 I think?)\n\nTHE CONS\n- Sometimes food is waiting at the front of the kitchen so long it becomes cold when it arrives. I once ordered a steak which was COLD when I got it.\n- Some mussels (like the garlic butter one - which is basically replacing French snails l'escagot with mussels) are super small for the price you are paying, it's almost not worth it.\n- The place is always packed. Most of the time it is also packed with big groups of loud and rowdy people.\n- Our order literally took over 1 hour to arrive. We were a group of 18 or so people. Really? Most of us ordered mussels! You just put different sauce in! - However, the manager agreed with our complaint and took off the price of starters (but only a few people ordered starters)"

But when we reached there, it was just about 15 minutes for the table (extremely reasonable considering it was saturday evening) and the food was served at a miraculous pace. The mussels and the chicken were simply grand. I loved it. Loved the cute beer bible too. It was a bit loud in general, but it was in a good way, jovial, bustleing, more like. I'd say it's worth visiting (especially for the lunch menus). Would definitely re-visit."

At the bar I asked if they could be heated up so they was hot. The oldest member of staff at the time deal with us and gathered the dinners to be warmed. Then shouted across the bar. These people are complaining their dinners are cold just dealing with this. Once the dinners came back they where hot and very nice. I'll not be going here again due to the staff attitude and the dinners in the Spanish galleon just down the road was £9.95. And look so much better and hotter. Plus the staff had a better attitude. It was also £2 a round cheap. Our round was 2 drinks. "

This was dining heaven!! the dishes were incredible the wine was a real treat to the pallet and the chef, I believe it may have been Monica on the pass and the team that produced the dishes I would liked to have thanked personally at the end of the evening as they had designed a menu for my wife which had to be gluten free.

It has a pleasingly higgledy piggledy interior, lots of small pokey rooms, and a courtyard outside which seems to be in use for a surprising amount of the year.\n\nBoth times I've been here to eat and I've enjoyed the food, most recently a Saturday lunchtime, when I was pleased to see two imaginative vegetarian options on the menu (I went for the stuffed Savoy cabbage, filled with mushrooms and pearl barley). It's a Fuller's pub, so expect the usual Fuller's selection of ales, plus one or two guest ales.\n\nStaff were very welcoming, and it seemed to be mostly table service - not normally my preference when it comes to pub food - but here it seemed to make sense. Kid friendly too - perhaps because of the time of day we were there, but most of the tables seemed to be occupied by families."

Or maybe tonight's crew needs a lesson in customer service. From time to time, I can get a room with missing something or broken something. It's how the hotel fixes the problem is what's important. I called the receptionist, hotel duty manager, house keeping all multiple times. Their phones rang endlessly. No answer from any of them. It's past 12 midnight and had to go down the reception. I asked the person on duty what is the best number to dial to get a hold of someone in this hotel. He said the receptionist. Well, I mentioned to him that I dialed it multiple times and all it did was ring. What he said to me was that they were too busy to answer the call. What? I'm in the service industry. You answer that damn phone within 2 to 3 rings. If you are busy, you can tell them that you need to call them back. You don't ignore that phone rings. REALLY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE WORSE I'VE HAD IN ALL MY TRAVELS. \n\nThe only reason i am not giving this a one star is because of their concierge, Smitty. He's very helpful. Otherwise. ONE stars."

I got the feeling of being a second class citizen as I was attending a sci-fi convention. Not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel and has made me reluctant to go back.

Not only the food was crap, it's was my nephew's birthday and every one invited was told the car park was free, that is On exit your parking ticket will be swapped for a free exit ticket like most hotel events I attended in UK. At the front desk £7 was demanded from every one wanting to leave. It was such a joy killer and total embarrassment for my nephew. Some of the quests were disgusted and it spoiled the special moment for my nephew who came down to tell the front desk man that his deal included free parking. Ugly scenes erupted as the front desk was having none of it. This hotel is a complete disgrace and I really cannot imagine why people wanting to celebrate such a special occasion would want it to be held in such an unruly place. The owners / operator should hang their head in shame. They spoilt Andrew's big moment."

Summer is a great time to hang out here since the sunshine is still golden right after work, and it's honestly nice to pop a squat outside Wilton's to drink in Graces Alley. \n\nNot that the tables inside aren't somehow perfectly rustic, and all the hipster paraphernalia that seems to come out of a box fits in well here. The stairs look like they'll collapse soon, and there are little goblets of flowers on the tables.\n\nBeers are standard central-London prices, but they serve up some nice brews, especially from Kernel from just south of the river. Highly recommend the citra IPA for a good hoppy kick in the teeth as the sun goes down.\n\nRandom, but Wilton's has such nice-smelling soap in its bathrooms. That's all."

We ordered the Signature Dim Sum Menu for 4. After the first course I noticed that the queue waiting for tables had grown and that the service had speeded up to a rush. They have quite small tables but now most of the courses very arriving making it uncomfortable to enjoy eating with a table brimming with plates. After the dessert plates very removed, a member of the waiting staff asked if everything was ok because they needed the table! Our intention was to finish our drinks and then leave but we were now a burden and once £345 had been extracted from my wallet they were happy to show us the door. Michelin Star service I don't think so. My advise is to pay a bit more and have the full experience at Hakkasan and Hkk."

Still we did not look like we just climbed off an oil rig and were still dressed appropriate.\nLondon is famous for it`s inferior cuisine, but this is a shining example of the new London with excellent choices. Each of our dishes were superior.\nRegrettably, the experience was tarnished by the most inferior service imaginable. As we were not regulars, came with young teenagers, and did not order alcohol, we were treated like second class citizens. While other tables where lavished with multiple servers, even those with only two people, were waited on hand and foot, we were basically ignored after we placed our order. \nI felt like we were at a snoot-fest and we were the inbred cousins who crashed the party. \nWe were shown a dessert menu, but this was merely a perfunctory effort as no one was really interested in taking our order. It`s a shame, because it probably would have been equally as delicious as the dinner and we most definitely would have ordered desserts. \nFrustrated by the quality of the service being a direct opposite of the quality of food, we got our check and left dissatisfied, despite eating what would be our finest dinner in London.

With regards the main courses, the most popular for flavour was the grilled Lobster, but again the portion was small, I had the Christmas Turkey dinner, it was unedible, the potatoes tasted like they were reheated, and the food was barely warm and where were the Sprouts? I could not eat it. The waiter said I should have complained, but to be perfectly honest, the services was such a shambles I lost my appetite, some of the side dishes, were still coming to the table after a couple of people had finished eating and if I had complained, my food would have arrived after everyone else had finished eating. It was such a shame as this was our annual Xmas dinner, there was no party atmosphere and overall we would give Langans a score of 4/10. The best part of the evening was Kay Presto!"

I dined here for a party and I found the service and food to be well above my expectation. \n\nI was unambitious with my food choices: lobster salad to start and rib-eye steak as a main. The lobster salad was the biggest surprise - the lobster was much higher quality than I normally expect in a mid-market London restaurant and the salad was very well balanced in terms of flavour. I don't think I've had a salad I've enjoyed that much in a long time. The steak was also better than I was expecting - cooked exactly to order and very tender. Additionally, the steak knife was razor sharp, which made eating the steak much more civilised than normal. Other people on the table were more ambitious. The eponymous snails were apparently very good, and the fish dish (bass, I think) was well received. The one element letting the food down was that it was all a little too salty for my taste. \n\nThe wine was very good - I only drank the red but the white was apparently the better bottle. The service was warm and friendly right from the lady at front of house, though a few inexperienced (but still friendly) staff prevented them from scoring perfectly. \n\nI will definitely be going here again at some point to experience more of the menu. It's excellent value. "

Service was slow and poor. Quality of food was terrible. Very overpriced. Far better restaurants to go to in the area. Sadly once a great restaurant and now below average."

This visit was to celebrate our 10th anniversary which I mentioned in my booking in hopes of getting a 'special' table. It was such a nice surprise to not only get that but glasses of champagne on arrival and madelines with 'Bon anniversarie' written on the plate for dessert. Needless to say the service was brilliant, the food exquisite and atmosphere enjoyable. It may not be the 'new & trendy' kid on the block but sometime spending time with a trusty old friend is just what you need, like going home for a big friendly hug."

It's fairly recent renovation (spa included) has updated the style to a modern 'oriental-chic'. Suffice it say, there is still more than a hearty dose of festal red on display. Which certainly goes a long way to maintain the lavish opulence of the place. And if the rouge of the interiors were a gentle reminder that Christmas was fast approaching, the giant fir flanking the grand entrance was a less subtle nod to everybody's favourite day. From the elegant, banister hugging, festive runners, to the roaring log fire, the Four Seasons did a superb job of readying its patrons for Christmas. I must admit, I was hard pressed to make it out to a meeting here with two lovely American bloggers. The cold, wet December evening and an early start the next day formed a compelling incentive to stay at home. But ten minutes in and happily swilling a delicious Côtes du Rhône, the looming prospect of work the next day had vanished from my thoughts. The service was exemplary, if only because it was barely discernable. \n\nCheck out my other favourite places and photos on Triptease. "

The club is covered in old album covers, music posters and drinks advertising that makes it feel like a true music-lovers venue. Staff were polite and drinks are pretty cheap considering the location. The back room has room to sit and offers up retro gaming classics - pinball and Mrs. Pacman! There was a live band playing that provided atmosphere, but you could still easily hold a conversation without shouting. Definitely worth a visit."

When i said i thought that was rediculous, he replied that he has a friend working at another hotel where its even more. Basically saying deal with it. Youre better of getting a internet sim on the high streets.\n\nThe second issue was in the room. You could clearly see the made went through it quickly. Thats a problem in current day hotels as they have to manage to clean a lot in little time. The toilet seat was spotted and so was the sink. Not a nice idea to go to the toilet. Also everything from the hallways to the rooms smell after chloride. Again not nice. In my room upon enteri i found the heating turned on its highest and on the warmest setting. Again, not what youre hoping for after a days hard work. The room i stayed in was 596. I guess normalky it would be a nice room if clean.\n\nWith breakfast asking for a cappuccino is to much. It will cost me an additional 4.35 pound (!) and the breakfast is 13.50 pounds. Price for breakfast is ok, but for my croissant and scrambled egg one might expect a bit more service translated in a cappucino. But 4.35 is an absolute rip off! The waiter smiled and seriously asked if i wanted one. Uhm no, ill get a proper one from Costa thank you.\n\nThe TV System is very buggy, and every channel keeps lagging or just freezes up.\n\nEveryone is trained to get more money and up sell, service is clearly second. And thats what is wrong with this hotels management. I would strongly unadvice this hotel to any friend or family for the moment being.\n\nPs what is really nice is that they have a kids congierge. Albeit i dont have any myself, I do like that idea / service.\n\nStayed July, 2014, business trip"

Advance booking is necessary!\nTom's kitchen is located in a beautiful townhouse, off King's Road and within walking distance from South Kensington station. It's bright and sunny; elegantly decorated without being too posh. The clientele is young couples or families with little kids.\nThe food is very good: I recommend the Egg Royale, poached eggs served on English muffins with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce, and the French Toast.

There were quite some space to stand around, the barmaid was quite attentive (I am so sorry that our group took a while to decide what we were ordering) and she remained patient. The other patrons are all well dressed and noone was drunk, this is a good sign.\n\nSometimes you could smell tantalising food being delivered to patrons, the smell of jacket potatoes were so good. Next time I will definitely order food here if I had no other plans.\n\nNo wonder, that time after doing some filming as an extra in China Town, I saw Jason Statham walk straight into this pub.

We sat down and were given postcards of the view from the restaurant, which we were told could be written and sent to anywhere in the world. My date was quick to take advantage of this, sending the postcard to New York!\nThe food itself was also beautifully presented and a real gastronomic delight. Special mention in particular to my main - a lamb reforme with a pomme mousseline (basically the smoothest and richest mash you will ever have), with a slice of truffle and a rich sauce poured over at your table. Ermagaad. Also to my dessert! A light and crisp rose meringue, on top of which a light coating of vanilla studded cream, capped with a mushroom-head of violet meringue. So fragrant and floral, it was like eating a bouquet. A pleasant surprise of truffles and raspberry jellies (you would have thought to end the meal), and a candy-jar of green apple and passionfruit marshmallows! A decadent night from which we left, glowing."

It's in a rather strange place to be honest, a spooky backstreet that would fit-in on the set of a murder mystery/Sherlock. That door is there and promises much....\nInside you are greated immediately with a wonderful spiral staircase that, with the thanks of various mirrors, seems to go on forever somehow....\nYou'll find a museum in the basement which, unless you're really into magic history, may leave you cold (there is a Sooty in there though, he's a member)!\nThere is also a bar area and kind of reception room with a statue of the founder, good for functions one would imagine.\nDuring the christmas show all these areas were littered with magicians doing close-up tricks and it was amazing.\nFinally, we have the theatre itself, it's small, of course, but complete. It's a proper fine theatre and of course nice and intimate, as magic should be.\nI'm so glad to have gone and really hope to return. I can't wait..."

And what better place to do it than the Hippodrome Casino? While the Maple Leaf was the first venue of choice, the Canadian Meetup Group made arrangements for some loud and rowdy Canadians to watch the game in the first floor bar area. \n\nNever have I felt so classy wearing my red CANADA shirt, and jumper, while waving a massive flag and donning a maple leaf hat. There were extra chairs and tables brought out to the main bar area, a very posh lounge was set up with comfy couches and extra TV's, and they even opened up the cabaret theater to show the game on their massive screen! \n\nThe amazing thing is that, amongst all the rowdy crowd who were jumping around, spilling beer everywhere, we received nothing but friendly top-notch service. A few things to note that I was impressed with: \n\n- 24-hour bar menu with decent price / quality food. £5 for 10 wings, £7.50 for burger & chips. Not sure where else you'd go for something like this around Leicester Square!\n- The room was packed, people sitting in booths were annoyed that people standing around were blocking their view (but hey, where else were they to stand??). But the workers decided to drag out ALL their chairs, making sure everyone had a comfy seat, and no one's view was blocked. Ace.\n- Our food order took an extremely long time - understandable that the kitchen was backed up with the few hundred Canadians that showed up! After checking with the waiter to make sure our order was at least in the system (and not lost), our order finally came out, along with a massive pitcher of complimentary beer. I wasn't even upset to begin with, I wasn't even expecting anything for free. But they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Funny enough, when the pitcher of beer was set down, Canada scored :) \n\nWhile this isn't a review on the actual gambling facilities, I think this is a great spot to catch the game with your buddies. Decent food for decent prices, posh facilities with friendly service. Felt pretty Canadian to me :) \n\nBTW, Team Canada won gold 3-0. GO CANADIA!"

In our opinion it is an absolutely lovely place to relax and enjoy superb food, great service (all the staff are extremely polite, but not overbearingly so), and take advantage of a luxury spa. Breakfast and dinner (in the Brasserie) were wonderful. Lots of choice, and absolutely everything we had was cooked and presented to perfection. Top marks! The gardens are nice, the patio a real sun spot, and everywhere is clean and tidy. If you look hard, and take your eyes off of the job of sunbathing or drinking a nice cocktail, you'll notice the staff are always beavering away as discretely as possible. For example, when you find a table to sit at outside, it is not pre-filled with the previous occupants left-overs. The gardens were maintained daily. There's no litter anywhere. Flowers and nice décor as far as the eye can see - indoors and outdoors. Our room was to a high standard. Very comfortable bed, full use of Sky TV, shower/bathroom lovely. Can't see how or why anyone would complain, but like I said at the beginning, we all have different experiences. Just pleased to say, ours was a brilliant one! We got a great deal pre-booked before we arrived, saving quite a bit off from the price if booked directly through the hotel's own web site. All in all, this is a really enjoyable place to stay for 2/3 days and we highly recommended it."

The chicken itself was meant to have been cooked in a tandoor prior to being added to the sauce - it clearly had not as it did not have any of the delicious smokey, charred flavour you supposedly pay extra for. The sauce it came in was literally inedible-it was artificially red and tasted of nothing but sugary, grainy coconut. The sweetness was cloying. I was particularly surprised by the lack of any spice as I had asked for it to be spicier than usual as often chicken tikka masalas can be on the too mild side. My girlfriend ordered a completely different main course but to our horror it came with the same horrible sauce. Neither of us ate any of it. We informed the staff, who where very apologetic and removed the items from our bill. They where also generous enough to offer us another chicken tikka masala to take home - lucky us! Needless to say we declined the offer and left swiftly. If you want a proper curry head down the road to Tooting "

So I went inside only to wait about 10 mins in the stifling heat for the very slow staff to serve the people before me. Then on my second attempt to go to the bar there wasn't a queue, but someone before me and a girl behind the bar fully aware of our presence but far too busy stocking a cigarette machine. When I was finally served I was given a pint that wasn't even filled to a pint that cost £5.35! I will not being returning and I would recommend others avoid this place. "

The staff are always pleasant and the times I have gone there in a large group they have always moved tables or gone out of their way to make us find a place that we will be happy with. The selection of drinks is great and the normal average price, and the food is nice with some items on the menu changing from time to time. It's a great all round place really!"

Very little distortion, ideal volume - I was so impressed I tipped the guys working the sound desk £10 to get themselves a couple of pints!\n\nFantastic energy at the gig, felt like being back at small intimate gigs at The Wedgewood rooms back in the 90s :)\n\nThe staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place for a quiet drink or a big night out, and hope to return sooner rather than later.

DON'T come here with children, and by the looks of some of the other reviews on the web about the manager's rudeness and the over-pricing, don't come here without them either!"

To this day, what happened at The Dog & Duck remains a crowd favourite whenever I am in a social gathering and the people around me start to share bizarre stories. I walk in with my wife and the place seemed nice and quaint. We asked for a couple of pints and ordered our fish and chips, and bubble and squeak. While we are waiting for our food we spot a mouse running around, under tables and people's chairs while they are enjoying themselves and are completely oblivious to the fact that the creature is there. While we are enjoying our pints, the bar tender \"passes gas\", or if you may, \"farts\" and it was a loud one. He smirked and probably thought to himself \"nobody heard that\". Well guess what, this Portuguese-Canadian did. After laughing about it and asking myself, where the f--- am I?, I tell the bar tender that there is a mouse running around in the pub. He says \"are you sure?\" I said, I only had a couple of pints, my sight is still pretty good and it surely wasn't a Dog nor a Duck. He said \"well maybe it's from the construction next door. I assure you it has nothing to do with the cleanliness of the establishment.\" REALLY?! Coming from the guy that just farted?!\nIf it weren't for the exhaustion of a long flight from Toronto, I would have probably been upset, since it was the first day of our honeymoon and tour across Europe, we just laughed it off.\nI highly suggest renaming it to The Dog, Duck and Mouse. Or just get a Cat."

It is very impressive on the outside and equally impressive on the inside with high ceilings, copious amounts of polished wood, etc. Remanants of (original?) partitions divide the space into various seating areas and there is a fine upstairs bar / dining area reached by a superb winding staircase. Most impressive, from my perspective, are the ten handpumps dispensing a range of standard Nicholson's regulars - Pride, Timothy Taylor's Landlord, Adnam's Broadside, Sharp's Doom Bar, etc. as well as guests. With this pub on the corner, why on earth would you go to the dingy William Morris 'spoons just along the road?"

They would also greatly benefit from a table numbering system as the waitresses were all over the place not knowing which plates were going where! \nThe food was ok... nothing exciting and definitely not good value for money.

In a very competitive market where profit margins are narrow and squeezed you cant act like an arrogant twat without consequences, and this manager is so unskilled, so unprofessional, and so completely useless, it beggars belief. He should not even be employed to clean the toilets as he'd find a way of fcking that up to, he literally can not organise a piss up in a pub, but does seem to have the ability of ending a piss up in a pub.

Its got a lovely family feel though given its location could do with a lick of paint and a bit of a spruce on the menu.

Chef Alex Chow's menu is truly inspirational - taking Chinese food to the next level by combining modern ingredients. The wasabi prawns are a must have and if you feel indulgent the Wagyu beef is truly amazing - very juicy, tender and just the right combination of flavours to melt in your mouth. Dishes such as Lamb with Szechuan Peppercorn were nice and definitely very creative. Soft shell crab was also good but I think Hutong's is slightly better (IMO). \n\n Kai has an extensive wine and cocktail list which is handy if you have many people to please. Deserts were also great the ‘Peranakan’ mango cake was amazing and one fellow diner enjoyed the six shades of chocolate. Service was discreet and prompt, cannot fault the manageress or host, everything was smooth without being too overbearing and all requests were managed carefully. Not your everyday Chinese but truly one of the top contenders if not The Best Chinese restaurant in the UK fully deserving of its Michellin star status."

The food is generally good, I would say it's the best feature of the place: on a sunny midday where the place is less packed the whole experience is probably really nice. The ground floor bar looks relatively lively, but I had a slight feeling it was trying to be something it wasn't. At about 81 pounds for 2 cocktails (one non alcoholic), one mixed starter, three mains, coconut rice, espresso and a sweet, it's a bit less cheap than I would expect a chain of this kind to be."

Born in 1415, due to the fringe theatre upstairs and football screenings, the patronage is a really mixed bag. This oddity is one of the things that sets the Old Red Lion apart from other pubs in the area; you never know who you’ll meet at the bar. \nInspired by his love of public houses, owner Damien took over the Old Red in 1999 and runs it as a family business. This TSL favourite does all sorts - but definitely check out their ‘Comedy Commentary‘, a hilarious event during which a roster of talented comedians take turns in commentating over live football on the big screen. \n\nCheck out our website Twenty Something London for more on great local places.

And he ought to know.\n\nIn an unexpectedly industrial feeling location around Chelsea Harbour way, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were looking for number 606. You aren't - that's in homage to where the club originally was on King's Road. Now it's accessed via a red brick arch, an intercom and a jaunt through the blissful Boho mild chaos of the front office, which reveals this gem of a club and it's true sabby chic, intimate, interior. It fits 165, but really just feels like someone's amazing front room. With live music and food.\n\nIt’s a small club with tables radiating out from the stage in the centre. Wherever you sit, you’ll get a great view. With musicians every day, sometimes twice, you can be assured that every effort has gone into getting the very best acts out there. This is a true jazz club just as it should be."

I loved the idea of picking whatever you like from the menu and decided which course you would like it for, rather than being restricted by only set starters and mains. I ordered Gnocci to start and it was perfectly cooked with fresh peas, and a nicely small portion so that you dont feel too full. I then had pork belly with chorizo and tempura courgette flowers. The pork belly was so tender and flavoursome, it may just be the best thing i've ever eaten, and the whole plate was balanced beautifully. For dessert i chose a mango brulee with passion fruit jel and chocolate. The brulee itself was lovely but i did find that there was too much chocolate, and the richness did not lend itself well with the mango which was suprising. i did however taste their pistaccio soufle with chocolate sauce which was heavenly. The sommelier was very friendly and informative and made great reccomendations based on tastes and food that was ordered. The restaurant itself is comfortable and stylish, with staff to match, without being snobby. Will definately book again."

The decor was quirky and comfortable, with a good amount of seating. They were playing catchy old reggae and similar type music all night which made a nice setting for drinks and conversation. The staff were amazingly pleasant and fun. The only drawback was the closing time, but I'm sure that is down to location. I'd definitely go back if in the area. "

No Fish!!\nWhen writer and performer Danny Braverman inherited a shoebox that belonged to his great uncle Abraham ‘Ab’ Solomons, there was nothing for it but to share its contents with the world. Because inside that shoebox lay a lifetime of memories, an honest expression of love, and a witty and perceptive artistic talent. Uncle Ab had provided a chronicle of married life in London’s East End Jewish community, drawn on little brown wage slips. In Wot? No Fish!!, currently playing at the Battersea Arts Centre, Braverman shares this insight into Ab’s life.\n\nOne week in 1926, shoemaker Ab Solomons decided to doodle on the wage slip that he gave to a girl called Celie Brenner. Celie was Ab’s wife, but she was also his muse and his audience. Over the next sixty years, every week, Ab would draw snapshots of their life together. Humorous, tender, sober, even raunchy (!), Ab’s doodles to Celie give a glimpse into their relationship, their faith, and their community. As the years passed and the doodles became detailed miniature artworks, major events punctuate the drawings. Celie and Ab have two children, they survive the Blitz, and their son gets admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Their relationship is tested to the limit and they endure heartbreaking loss, but throughout, Ab continues his pictures for Celie, even graduating to Technicolor on his retirement.\n\nIn Wot? No Fish!! Danny Braverman carefully sifts through the 2,500 or so little brown wage packets to present snippets of his great uncle and aunt’s history. Using a projector to show each drawing, Braverman’s one-man show and tell is simple in its structure, taking us from birth to death and everything in between. His show is a mixture of lecture and performance, with Braverman including his audience in the story from the outset: handing out cooked fish balls for them to eat (delicious!) and throwing questions to those watching.\n\nBraverman is an excellent storyteller, knowing how to please and enrapture his audience. He has clearly carefully studied Ab’s drawings, and offers his interpretation of what Ab might have been thinking and feeling. He masterfully presents his chosen selection of wage-packet drawings, turning over the envelopes like a fortune teller revealing life’s cards. Braverman also enlightens his audience, teaching them about religious and cultural traditions.\n\nWot? No Fish!! is a creation of the Bread & Circuses Theatre Company: a collaboration between Danny Braverman and director Nick Philippou. It runs at the Battersea Arts Centre until 19th July. It’s a fresh love story told through the eyes of a man who understands that every day matters, and is a delight to watch."

Of a pint of beer and maybe no insults to go with it??! (I know, so bloody naive-And I gave them a fiver to be offended?) If I'd known I'd gone in for some sort of derogatory treatment, I probably would have settled for Browns strip club across the road.I hate it when bitchy queens get all high and mighty. especially when they are being paid £6.50 an hour. I hope you get Ebola. Merry Christmas."

We were greeted and seated by Garry who was an excellent host, juggling all the tables on his own with amazing success. \n\nThe menu is good. We ordered the crumbed prawns & scampi and the steak frites. Both dishes were good value, well presented and arrived very quickly. \n\nThe tables either side of us went for the fish and chips, which looked extremely good. The fish is served in deep fried in beer batter, comes with mushy peas and diners have the choice of a regular or large portion.\n\nWe will certainly be returning next time we are in the West End, but will probably use the online booking facility to ensure we get a table."

It was perhaps a little expensive, but it was totally worth it!\nThe stuff is polite and attentive.\n\nOh, and this place is dogs friendly, as there is a water bowl for dogs inside the pub :) Occasionally you can see some happy doggies chilling in the pub, while their owners enjoy the pint :)\n\nThere are a couple of bike-racks outside the pub, which is handy for us cyclists.

There is a long bar filled with bottles of alcohol. A huge metal murial on oneside and a long wineglass chandelier in the middle. The toilets are tiny, you really have to squeeze in to shut the door.\n\nThe staff are friendly and attentive. The cocktail list is full of new cocktails that i have never heard of before. Some of the recipies from America's prohibition period.\nI settled on a Senitmenalt Melody and a Carol Channing.\n\nA basket of bread was provided, very tasty but we were not told what they were but looking on the other review here I now know,\nI decided on the traditional Prawn cocktail or as they call it a Shrimp cocktail. \nThis was delicious but a let down prawn wise. There was a small round of lettuce and fennel topped with what seemed like 4 prawns and marie sauce and grapefruit. However it was actually 2 prawns sliced in half, so not enough prawns to eat with the greens. This dish cost £14.50 thats £7.25 a prawn!!!!!!!!! I might try the clam chowder or smoked salmon next time.\n\nFor the main we decided on the Rib eye steak and wow that was superbly cooked. We shared some sides with it of macaroni cheese with truffle oil ( a delight on the taste buds), cayenne fries and hillbilly slaw.\n\nFor dessert i settled on good old pecan brownie with ice cream and WOW that was the most moist rich brownie ever tasted. \n\nI definitely recommend this place for classy American dining at reasonable prices considering where its based."

While it was not exactly close to where I lived or worked, I went there quite frequently with my friends. The best place to sit during winter is on the comfortable sofa next to the fireplace. Enjoying the cosy atmosphere with a glass of red wine - few things can beat that. I have only eaten there once - no complaints about the food, but we usually ordered some snacks with our drinks and I must say they do have a nice selection. Highly recommended!"

First entered to generally surly and uninterested staff even though the place was empty. I ordered a rib-eye steak (well, it was my birthday). The steak was priced at £16.90. A reasonable price considering it was an Angus steak and this place was trying to cast itself off as a bit of a gastro pub, apparently. However, what I got was resembling an old piece of tough leather. It was about the size of a sandwich steak, it was moderately warm on the outside and almost cold at the centre, leading me to believe that this steak had been cooked twice and was simply reheated for my lunch. It was disgusting Very poor all round. Even Wetherspoons serve much better steaks. I know where I will be going in the future. AVOID!"

For me the veg was a little over-cooked, but I tend to just wave my broccoli near a boiling kettle. Everything else was good, just, not stand-out / write-home fantastic.\nAt £20 for 3 courses though, it's really rather decent I think. Portions were also good in thought.\nIt's proximity to the park makes it perfect for a beer & a bite after a long lazy Sunday in the park."

I got to try many different kinds of lovely Belgian beers (one of my favourite things to do!!) that they have listed in a handy flip menu, sorted by type and with helpful descriptions. They're not cheap, but worth every penny. And always a nice touch that you get a matching glass for every beer. And to top off all of this they brought over a long slat of drinks for the table as a happy birthday to me - how thoughtful :-) Oh, and they stay open pretty late on a Saturday. Would definitely recommend this place to any beer lover out there, or anyone looking for a nice environment to have drinks with friends."

As an example, at the splendid Rocket pub on the Euston Road I've paid £5,29 for a truly great burger. That's A THIRD of what I paid at the Yorkshire Grey! I really hope this place goes out of business, it's a rip-off and piss-take from start to finish and should be avoided at all cost. I will certainly NEVER EVER come here again! "

The story goes that in 1966 after losing funding and having to close, the local community were so determined to keep the historic architecture that they took it down, piece by piece, and saved it for when money came by to put it back together...\n\nTo find more unique and independent places why not visit the Twenty Something London website!"

A welcome refuge from a classically hazy autumnal day, this place hit you with the familiar smell of woodsmoke soaked into oaken beams the second you walked through the door.

The team made us feel incredibly welcome, were very attentive and most of all, very friendly. The food was absolutely superb as well with every member of the group commenting on it!\n\nIn fact, we had such a great time we went back again for the England v Wales game and, yet again, had a fantastic time due to the great work of the staff and the fantastic food.\n\nThe proximity to St. Pauls made it a very easy place to find and an excellent meeting point for a large group of people.\n\nIt is now my go-to pub in the city and I would strongly advise others to try it!"

It is an adults bar and the age of the clientele tends to be older than places like g.a.y. It's a great place to meet other men, most of whom pride themselves on their masculinity. You get your mix of bears, some leather men, smartly dressed, older guys and young twinks. Inside, it's a great mix of traditional decor, calm ambience and pre-party atmosphere with DJ's on the weekend. You can sit in comfort up in the lounge and chat, or cruise and mingle with freedom downstairs with decent house music playing in a darker, cruiser atmosphere with disco lights. Whilst some people have moaned about the service, the guys in bar are good looking, genuine nice people. They're a mix of English and other nationalities. Once they've seen your face a few times, their honest friendliness shows through, unlike a fake smiling trolly-dolly! So, I don't accept the poor service comments. If you compare it to other places which can be much slower during busier times, they are not bad at all! It's a great meeting place and its always busy. It's an institution, it's friendly, honest, friendly regulars and most gay visitors first port of call in Soho. "

The lighting's fairly dim so not everyone will be able to read the specials board all the way in the back of the restaurant, but the staff are well-versed in the day's offerings and make good calls on what to try. \n\nTables tend to be very small and cramped though, so if you're ordering a few dishes to share you might end up having to play 3D tetris with the plates and bowls.

Having bought 2 bottles of wine (not house) at £18.45 per bottle, I then asked for 1 glass of the same wine and a large brandy (not house, but Hennessey or something similar). I was then charged £19 for the 2 drinks. £10 for a large brandy and £9 for a glass of wine !! Sadly will not be using or recommending this pub again."

The pub itself is spacious, has seating of varying type (dining table, sofas, high tables) and a friendly atmosphere. "

The bar gets busy after hours but we have always managed to find a seat even if the couches sink a little bit too low. You get so comfortable that you always end up staying longer than planned. There are so many different beers and ciders on tap its easy to want to try them all. If ordering food, they are honest about the wait time and to be quite honest it is worth the wait. If you haven't already been there it is worth giving it a go. "

There was something magical about that room.\n\nWe then made our way to the top floor gallery and roof terrace. The gallery was very spacious with modern furniture, bar, pillars throughout the whole room and absolutely gorgeous view of the canal and the Olympic Stadium through long glass windows.\n\nAfter viewing the paintings and having a few drinks and canapes in the gallery, we decided to check out the restaurant and bar on the 1st floor. \nJust before we walked into the bar and restaurant area, there was a big glass window into into the smokery, where we could see some people at work preparing salmons for smoking.\n\nWe could not resist the temptation and decided to have some food and wine here. Their smoked salmon platter is to die for! It came on a wooden-board with about 8 different types of smoked salmon, including beetroot and wasabi flavorings, and accompanied with mini-blinis and freshly baked bread. We also had a glass of English red wine, which was quite impressive.\n\nThe restaurant had a modern and relaxing feel, and it was quite busy with customers. \nWe managed to grab a table on the balcony, which had a very cosy and romantic set up with candles on the tables and a spectacular view of the canal and the Olympic stadium. It was perfect, as it was one of the warmest evening in London.\n\nOur waiter was very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us some good tips on upcoming events in the area and Forman's Smokehouse.\n\nThere is a secured free Wi-Fi available in the Bar and Restaurant area.\n\nI have very quickly become a fan of this place, and i cannot wait to come back soon and introduce this wonderful hidden gem to my friends and relatives.\n\nFor those who cycle, there are cycling-racks available inside the car park next to the Forman's Smokehouse ;)"

We ordered food (which at around £12-16 a main was quite expensive but felt like that we had earned it). After waiting around an hour and having ordered another round of drinks we asked where our food was. They informed us that they had not passed that to the kitchen and now it was closed and so we would not be getting any food. They refunded us the money (although not for the extra drinks we had ordered waiting). While this was annoying it was the incredibly rude and dismissive way in which they informed us which made me feel I should write a review. \n\nThis was not an isolated incident on the day as the table next to us only received half their food (not sure how that is possible) and another table didn't receive theirs. The food some people did receive looked ok but it looked a bit overpriced for what it was.\n\n"
